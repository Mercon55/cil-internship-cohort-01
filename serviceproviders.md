Developers deploy directly from popular tools like Git, GitHub or Continuous Integration (CI) systems. The intuitive web-based Heroku Dashboard makes it easy to manage your app and gain greater visibility into performance.

- Data Services and Ecosystem

Heroku Elements let developers extend their apps with Add-ons, customize their application stack with Buildpacks and jumpstart their projects with Buttons. Add-ons are 3rd party cloud services that developers can use to immediately extend their apps with a range of functionality such as data stores, logging, monitoring and more. Heroku provides three fully-managed data service Add-ons: Heroku Postgres, Heroku Redis, and Apache Kafka on Heroku.

- Heroku Runtime

Heroku runs your apps inside dynos — smart containers on a reliable, fully managed runtime environment. Developers deploy their code written in Node, Ruby, Java, PHP, Python, Go, Scala, or Clojure to a build system which produces an app that's ready for execution. The system and language stacks are monitored, patched, and upgraded, so it's always ready and up-to-date. The runtime keeps apps running without any manual intervention.

- Heroku Operational Experience (OpEx)

The Heroku Operational Experience is a key component of the platform. It helps developers through troubleshooting and remediation of common issues and customizing their ops experience to quickly identify and address negative trends in their application health. Heroku provides a set of tools to alert you if something goes wrong, or to automatically scale your web dynos if the response time for web requests exceeds a threshold you specify. Application metrics, Threshold Alerting, and Autoscaling are some of the features you get access to with no extra cost.

- Heroku Accommodates Many Development Languages

Heroku supports several programming languages that are used as a web application deployment model. As one of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007. Back then, it supported only the Ruby programming language.

But now it also supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. This means a variety of developers can look to Heroku for an inexpensive way to scale their application, no matter their preferred development language.

- Heroku Dynos Enable Easy Development and Better Usability

Applications that are run on Heroku typically have unique domain names, which are used to route HTTP requests to the correct container. Applications as services use application containers. Containers are designed to package and run services. Each of the application containers is а smart container on a reliable, fully-managed runtime environment. Application containers — referred to as “dynos” in the context of the Heroku platform — are spread across a “dyno grid.” This consists of several servers. The Dyno manager maintains and operates the created dynos.

All this means is that since Heroku manages and runs applications, there’s no need to manage operating systems or other internal system configurations.

### MICROSOFT AZURE
Azure is Microsoft's public cloud platform. Azure is a public cloud computing platform—with solutions including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) that can be used for services such as analytics, virtual computing, storage, networking, and much more. It can be used to replace or supplement your on-premise servers.

Azure offers a large collection of services including platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and managed database service capabilities. Azure, like other cloud platforms, relies on a technology known as virtualization. Most computer hardware can be emulated in software, because most computer hardware is simply a set of instructions permanently or semi-permanently encoded in silicon. Using an emulation layer that maps software instructions to hardware instructions, virtualized hardware can execute in software as if it were the actual hardware itself.

Azure is a huge collection of servers and networking hardware running a complex set of distributed applications to orchestrate the configuration and operation of the virtualized hardware and software on those servers. It is this orchestration that makes Azure so powerful, because users are no longer responsible for maintaining and upgrading hardware because Azure does all this behind the scenes.

Microsoft azure is ranked 2nd with a global market share of 18%

### Offerings of Microsoft Azure

1. Enhance and Implement Backup and Disaster Recovery

Azure is a backup and disaster recovery dream tool. Why? Because of its flexibility, advanced site recovery, and built-in integration.
As a cloud-based solution, Azure is innately flexible – it can back up your data in almost any language, on any OS, and from any location. Plus, you define the frequency and extent of your backup schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).

Tape backup has a time and place, but it has limited abilities as a stand-alone backup and disaster recovery solution. Azure site recovery can enhance your tape backup with offsite replication, minimal onsite maintenance, up to ninety-nine years of data retention, minimal or no capital investment, and minimal operational costs. Azure backup stores three copies of your data in three different locations in the data center, and then another three copies in a remote Azure data center, so you never have to worry about losing data.

If you’re in a Windows virtual environment, Azure’s built-in integration for additional backup will be a quick and painless solution. Azure site recovery integrates with System Center and HyperV architectures, creating a robust and seamless cohesion between Azure, System Center, and HyperV.

2. Host and Develop Web and Mobile Apps

Whether you’re looking for a platform for hosting, developing, or managing a web or mobile app, Azure makes those apps autonomous and adaptive with patch management, AutoScale, and integration for on-premise apps.

With Automatic patch management for your virtual machines, you can spend less time managing your infrastructure and focus on improving your apps. Azure also comes with continuous deployment support, which allows you to streamline ongoing code updates.

AutoScale is a feature built into Azure Web Apps that adjusts your resources automatically based on customer web traffic so you have the resources you need when traffic is high, and save money when you’re not in peak times.

Through Azure, you can seamlessly link your web app to an on-premise app. Connecting apps in both locations lets both employees and partners securely access resources inside your firewall—resources that would otherwise be difficult to access externally.

3. Distribute and Supplement Active Directory

Azure can integrate with your Active Directory to supplement your identity and access capabilities—this gives your DNS a global reach, centralized management, and robust security.

With Azure, you can globally distribute an Active Directory environment that is direct connect enabled. No other cloud provider has the ability to extend the reach of your domain controller and consolidate AD management like Azure.

If you have multiple locations or use on-premise apps or cloud apps like Microsoft 365, Active Directory integration with Azure will be the central tool for managing and maintaining access to all of these tools.

Azure also enables you to utilize multi-factor authentication, adding a new layer of security to your data and applications with zero hassle for your users. You can also easily implement single sign-on for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS cloud apps.

4. Innovate with IoT Industry Solutions

The scalability, flexibility, and security of Microsoft Azure makes it the perfect resource for companies moving toward IoT solutions. You can connect your devices to the cloud using solutions that integrate with your existing infrastructure and start collecting new data about your company.

Within the Azure IoT Hub, you can monitor and manage billions of devices and gain insights to help you make better business decisions, improve customer experiences, reduce complexity, lower costs, and speed up development.

The enhanced security of Azure is a huge asset for IoT solutions, which traditionally have security gaps that hackers can take advantage of. Other benefits include remote monitoring and predictive maintenance and analytics.
