#### Agile and Scrum processes.

##### What is Scrum?

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations 
generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. It is simple 
and wraps around existing practices or renders them unnecessary. Scrum makes
visible the relative efficacy of current management, environment, and work 
techniques, so that improvements can be made.

Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and to control risk. It engages groups of people who collectively have all the skills and expertise to do the work and share or acquire such skills as needed. 
It is an example of Agile methodology which is a people-focused,results-focused approach to software development that is centered around adaptive planning, self-organization, and short delivery times. It’s flexible, fast, and aims for continuous improvements in quality
 
In software development, scrum plays a major role in increasing quality and 
effectiveness in the domain of work. It also helps in optimizing the process of process of achieving the product goal. The fundamental unit of Scrum is a small team of people, a Scrum team. 
The Scrum Team consists of one Scrum Master, one Product Owner, and Developers. 
Within a Scrum Team, there are no sub-teams or hierarchies. It is a cohesive 
unit of professionals focused on one objective at a time, the Product Goal.

- A product owner makes a prioritized wish list known as a product backlog.
- Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to creating 
any aspect of a usable increment each Sprint.
- The scrum team takes one small piece of the top of the wish list called a 
sprint backlog and plans to implement it.
- The team completes their sprint backlog task in a sprint (a 2-4 week period). 
- They assess progress in a meeting called a daily scrum.
- The Scrum Master keeps the team focused on the goal.
- At the sprint’s end, the work is ready to ship or show. The team closes the 
sprint with a review, then starts a new sprint.

The scrum values which are - Commitment, Openess, Respect, Focus and Courage 
are always employed in every sprint till the product goal is obtained.
