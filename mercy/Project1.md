## Layered Processes in OSI Models

OSI Models is used to understand computer networks and how data is transferred from one form to the other. It has multiple layers of functions which are:
- Application
- Presentation 
- Session
- Transport
- Network
- Data Link
- Physical

and one of the layers is described below:

#### Presentation Layer

This layer receives data from application layer and this data is in form of Correctors- DFGJUYRG  and numbers- 64578995412. Then it converts these correctors and numbers, to machine understandable binary numbers. E.g Conversion of ASCII to EBCDIC code. This conversion is known as translation.

Presentation layer reduces the amount of data or bits that are used to represent the data. The bit reduction process is known as Data Compression, which can be lossy or lossless. To maintain the intergritty of data, data is encrypted by the sender and on the receiver's end, data is decrypted. SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) is used i encryption and decryption.

In conclusion, presentation layer performs three basic functions which are:
- Translation
- Data Compression
- Encryption/Decryption.
