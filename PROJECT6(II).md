# UI/UX DESIGN
## Task 1

### NOTE BOOK APP ON ANDRIOD
As the name implies, it makes it easy for quick jotting of idea or notes. However, the app does not have other functions that can help maximize the use.
These functions Includes:
* Adding of images for reference.
* Voice recording feature for taking down note. Especially for users with disabilities 
* Ability to share note.
* Ability to upload notes.
* A search bar for searching notes
* A way to pin the most important or urgent notes at the top.
* A way to schedule a note or set a notification to check the note later.

Considering the limitations, the app can only perform a function of just writing down a note.



### Linkedin App.
LinkedIn is a social network that focuses on professional networking and career development.

Using the mobile app I was able to perform my primary objective. Joining the app, it suggests people in your niche to connect with based on you profile, it also notifies you of job vacancies and expose you to their learning platform.

However here are some of the limitations I noticed using the mobile app:
* Difficulty finding the sign out button as a beginner
* Inability to send an in-connect message to someone you are trying to connect with. Sometimes the message box/button of top people on linkedin is locked and the best way to reach out to them is to connect by dropping a message while connecting. This feature is not present on the mobile app. However it is present on the website.
* Search filter limitation while searching people or jobs.
Having noticed these things, I came to the conclusion that not all features can be on the app and users can always go to the website for extensive search. However the sign out can be made more accessible except they aim for users to stay logged in.

### Gmail for web
Gmail is a free Web-based e-mail service that provides users with a gigabyte of storage for messages and provides the ability to search for specific messages.

Using the Gmail, It was easy to accomplish my goals. However, when you have more than one email attached to it, it becomes difficult to sign out a single email without signing out all the emails. This frustrated me and makes me question why I can’t have an option to sign out a single email too.


## Task 2
As a graphics designer, my work is related to that of a UI designer. I work with screens by creating visual designs to create or improve the aesthetics of a banner. Also, I use the fundamentals of Graphics design (color, typography etc.) to influence my design decision. This is related to what the UI design does

I can categorize him as a UI/UX designer


## Task 4.
I am a UI/UX designer. What I do majorly is provide the best experience for users by solving their problems and making their experience seamless. I do this by conducting user research, wireframes, visual designs, prototype and constant user testing.  I also ensure easy  interactions between screens.

Compared to other designers,
* UI/UX design is more extensive and incorporates other design field. 
* Compared to graphics design, UI/Ux is more than just aesthetics and careful considerations are used for each design decisions. 
* We often find other design fields in UI/Ux design e.g Graphics design, Motion design etc. 
* Other design field have little or no screen interactions.

The market is currently getting saturated with UI/UX designers however there are still opportunities. I intend to transition into a UI developer afterwards where I can do bot UI/Ux and frontend developmet. This will help me stay relevant.








## SECOND PROJECT

# UI/UX FUNDAMENTALS
Are you a newbie or are you looking to start a career in UI/UX design, In this article you will find the out the fundamentals of UI/UX design.

This is a short article and I will be sharing the following with you:
* What is UI design
* What is UX design
* Difference between UI and UX design
* Five main principles of UI/UX Design
* What do UI/UX Designers Do?
* Characteristics of a good user experience
* What’s next? Key takeaways and career in UX design.

## What is UI design
This the design of the interface and interaction people sees on website and apps. It includes all the visual aspects of the user's journey, including all the individual screens and touch points that the user might access.

## What is UX Design
This is the process of designing (digital or physical) products that are useful, easy to use, and delightful to interact with. It is all about the user, ensuring the delivery of easy and comfortable product for a user to use, taking into consideration their pain-points.

## Difference between UI and UX design
* UI deals only with visuals while UX deal with everything that will make the user experience better.
* It applies to both Physical and Digital product for Ux designs while it applies to just digital for UI design.
* UX design is more concerned about the user satisfaction while UI is more concerned about aesthetics and use of visual design principle.

## Five main principles of UI/UX Design
There are many principles of UI/UX design; these principles have been broken down into five main principles:
1.	Empathy
This is involves understanding the user and putting yourself in their shoes. As a UI/Ux designer it’s your duty to understand your user’s pain point, motivation , story and more. It is with this information you create a better experience.
2.	Strategy
This involves finding solutions and creating strategies to solve the user’s problems. It’s crucial for a UI/UX designer to have a well-defined plan and set of goals before starting any project.
3.	Usability
Users want a stress free product, this is why it’s important to create an easy to use product. A user might have had a stressful week, the moment they try to use a product to achieve a goal and they encounter difficulty, they opt out. You don’t want this as a Ui/Ux designer.
4.	Inclusivity
When you design, you should take into consideration users of all race, ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and more. When you do this you also solve their problems and make it easier them to make use of the product.
5.	Validation
This involves consistent testing of the product with the user to ensure it meets their needs. This must be done at every stage to ensure you are really designing what the user wants and to avoid wasting time and resources.

## What do UI/UX Designers Do?
	- Empathize:
    In this stage, the designer conducts extensive and inclusive research about the people who will be interacting with the product using either or both qualitative and quantitative approach. This involves: Surveys, Interviews, Focus groups

    - Define:
    After the user research has been completed, and the user’s goals and needs are understood, the UI/UX designers figure out and define what problems need solving, and set direct guidelines for the tasks ahead.
    
    -Ideate: 
    This is a brainstorming stage where the UI/UX designer comes up with ideas based on the information gather in the previous stages.
    
    -Prototype 
    This is the stage the designs are made and every information and ideas gathered in the previous stages are designed. It involves sketching, wireframes, high-fidelity designs, mockups etc.
    
    -Test
    As we have discussed previously, we can’t overemphasize the need for testing. Testing should be done regularly. Designers will observe their users interact with the designs and ask them to complete certain tasks or sort information. They take note of the user’s emotions, body language, statements, frustrations, and difficulties they have when using the product. After testing, designers compile the data, analyze it, and determine what improvements need to be made.

### ITERTE  ITERATE  ITERATE
Designers take what they’ve learned from previous ones and address new problems, make meaningful improvements, and design more effective solutions. Even after product release, designers will continue to obtain user feedback and iterate upon their original designs.
