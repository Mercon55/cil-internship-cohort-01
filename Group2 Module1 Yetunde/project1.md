# OSI MODEL
Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model.

TCP/IP 

Tramission control protocol/ Internet protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.

TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).It's specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. TCP/IP requires little central management and is designed to make networks reliable with the ability to recover automatically from the failure of any device on the network.
There is a Tcp/Ip model that groups:-

    Session, Presention and Application together as Application layer.
    Physical layer and Data link layer together as Link layer because they are much ralated in a networking perspective. so, we then have four in the Tcp/Ip model.

1. link layer: it is the lowest layer within the TCP/IP stack and its primary responsibility is to define how a computer connect to network. The link layer in the TCP/IP model is a descriptive realm of networking protocols that operate only on the local network segment that a host is connected to. Such protocol packets are not routed to other networks. The link layer includes the protocols that define communication between local (on-link) network nodes which fulfill the purpose of maintaining link states between the local nodes, such as the local network topology, and that usually use protocols that are based on the framing of packets specific to the link types.
   
2. Network layer: Delivers data in the form of a packet from source to destination, across as many links as necessary, to non-adjacent systems.

3. Transport layer it's the third layer of the four-layer TCP/IP model. The purpose of transport layer is to permit devices on the source and destination hosts to carry on a coversation. its defines the level of service and status of the connection used when transporting data like playing music online, chatting on whatsapp and downloading all at onec. the main protocol at transport layer are TCP (Transmission control protocol) and UDP(User datagram protocol).

4. Application layer: This layer is used by the end-user (who is at the application layer) can communicate directly with the software or application. just like when using an app or browser, you as the end user is getting and receiving data directly from the app. This layer identifies communication partners, resource availability and tries to make communication real-time, meaning you're getting your results immediately. Application layer is placed on the top of transport layer. Application layer includes all the higher level protocols like: HTTP(Hypertext transfer proocol), FTP(File transfer protocol), Telnet, X Windows, DNS(Domain naming system) etc.
