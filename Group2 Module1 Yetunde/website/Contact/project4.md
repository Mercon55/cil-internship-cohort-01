What exactly is UX design?

UX Design is User Experience, it is the overall exprience a user see when running or interacting with a product or Application. UX Design is how the application make things easy for you, is it better, is it nice, when running the application. it is the most important factor of an application and everything boils down on how the user experience it. if you have a graphics designer they work hand in hand with the UX basically, for instance shoes (product) have user interface & user experience if you are wearing your shoe how comfortable is that shoe? a product have user experience any product, that is why we say product design (is basically UI/UX). how is this thing going to look like which is the user interface but we are after how is it going to be comfortable for the user that is me and you and for the people that will use it.

    It’s all about designing specifically for the needs of the user or customer, looking at things like ease of use, quality, and efficiency.

UI Design fundamentals
1. Predictable and seamless elements, such as buttons you the make sure that the buttons are easy to see or click for the user, those are the things that are been notice by people. how the button is easlier to access is it comfortable if the person is left handed or righthanded.
2. Effective navigation, such as clearly labeled icons, some designs you won't know what the buttons or icon are for or what they are doing, the icons is important in UI design. They need to be more self explantory for the user to know the features
3. Frictionless and invisible interactions
4. Purposeful and clear tasks or goals: ypu need to define what you are doing, no need to prolong anything at all, make it straight to the point for the user, what a design or a particular icon is all doing. 
5. Guilded behavior with design patterns, and clear hierarchy and readable: you need to stay consiatnce with what you are using no need to v
5. Key features catch the user's attention: the importance features must be beautiful to catch your attention, which you the user.

UX Design fundamentals
1. User testing: is to see how people actually like it. some application like twitter they use to have testing and put little feature out and let people see if they like it, thats user testing.
2. Data analytics: is how people use it, or how its easy for people to access the data they keep 
3. Site mapping: is from your profile to wire frame, if you click on your profile you can see your tweet or you click on your whatsapp to check your status or call logs
4. User satifaction 
5. Prototyping 
6. Collaboration

Snapchat is kind of intrutive, because people get to send you streaks to you even when you are not interested. and it get to invade in someone's privacy, sometimes some important chats gets to push down by those people who always send streaks. its a mobile app and it have a very bad UI, if you want to go back on snapchat you have to use the forward botton and for you to locate were to chat or click on it you have to clear out some chat  or select more before you can access it. 

whatsapp it has a bad UX, its frustrating when it takes you back to you top chat after searching of a particular name but instead it takes you back to the top when you it should continue from your previous.

What is UX design?
is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

What does a UX designer actully do?

The UX designer role is to make a product or service usable, enjoyable, and accessible. While many companies design user experiences, is most often associated with digital design for websites and apps.
    1. Understand the user and the brand. Think about what problem you’re trying to solve for the user and how it will aligns with the brand goals.

    2. Conduct user research. Identify user needs, goals, behaviors, and pain points. Tools for user research might include surveys, one-on-one interviews, focus groups, or A/B testing. A UX researcher leads this process.

    3. Analyze what you’ve learned. you’ll build user personas based on your research to help you identify the most important elements of the product or service. Start to map out what the user flow will look like.

    4. Design. As you begin to build out the design, you’ll create site maps, wireframes, or prototypes to give you and your team a better idea of what the final product will look like. a user interface (UI) designer will add in visual or interface elements.

    5. Conduct user testing. Validate the design by tracking how real users interact with the product or service (usability testing). Identify any problems with the design and develop solutions.

    6. Present your work. Deliver the design solution to your client or company.

How is UX design different to other design fields?

    UX Designers have ALWAYS had to incorporate business needs into their designs, a fact that is supported by an analysis of job description. 

    They work to ensure that everything is easy, intuitive, and straightforward, so nobody feels lost or confused
    UX Designers spend most of their time developing products prior to launch.
