# OSI Model Task

## Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model

---

The TCP/IP protocol is similar to the OSI model. It is also called the internet protocol suite which is a set of standardized rules that allow computers to communicate on a network such as the Internet.
This protocol suite is made up of the transmission control protocol(TCP) and the internet protocol(IP). TCP breaks data down into packets and transmits them between server and client, while ensuring that data integrity is in place throughout the process
IP on the other hand ensures that the packets of data being transmitted gets to the right destination. It does this using methods and structures that place tags, such as address information within data packets.

TCP/IP has four layers:

1. Datalink layer
1. Internet layer
1. Transport layer
1. Application layer

Each layer is perfoms a different function and is there to set standards so that computers with different architectures can communicate seamlessly with each other.
