Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)

Just like people, it’s important for computers to have a common way to communicate with each other. This gave rise to Open System Interconnection Model (OSI Model) and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).
 
As stated earlier, the TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. TCP/IP is a set of standardized rules that allow computers to communicate on a network such as the internet.
By itself, an individual computer can perform any number of jobs. But computers’ real power shines when they communicate with each other. These computers maybe from different companies or located in different part of the world and operating on different computer languages.
 
How Computers Communicate
Computers communicate with themselves using Protocols. A protocol is an agreed upon set of rules. In human terms, we use social protocols (Social Skills) to know how to effectively communicate with each other. Communication was more complicated when people first started to exchange information between computers. Each manufacturer had its own way of communicating between its own computers but can’t communicate with other manufacturers computers. For example, IBM computers could only communicate with IBM computers only. Hence an agreed upon standard was needed that permitted computers from all vendors to communicate with each other, that brought about TCP/IP.

The Four Layers of the TCP/IP Model

TCP model is split into four distinct layers. Used together, they can also be referred to as a suite of protocols.
 
1. Application Layer:
The application layer is the group of applications that require network communication. This is what the user typically interacts with, such as email and messaging. The Application, Presentation and Session layer in OSI Model is grouped under Application layer in TCP/IP.

2. Transport Layer:
The transport layer is what provides a reliable data connection between two devices. It divides the data in packets, acknowledges the packets that it has received from the other device and makes sure that the other device acknowledges the packets it receives. By providing end to end connections, it allows establishment of data segments and delivery with error control by using TCP and UDP protocols

3. Network/Internet Layer:
The network layer controls the movement of packets around the network. It provides the logical addressing and routing of data packets using internet protocol like IPV4

4. Network Interface Layer:
The network interface layer (Also called the link layer, datalink layer, or physical layer) is what handles the physical parts of sending and receiving data using the ethernet cable, wireless network, network interface card, device driver, etc. It combines raw data into frames.
