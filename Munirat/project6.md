## Software Dvelopment and Process

### Question 1 : Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of its benefits in software development.

Scrum is a specific agile methodology  that is used by project managers. Agile methodology is a philosophy or set of values that is a people-focused, result-focused approach to software development and it is centered on adaptive planning, self organization and short delivery times.

Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering and sustaining complex products, it allows people to address complex adaptive problems while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. It organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal which is creating a ready for market product.
Scrum has been extensively used to ;
* research and identify viable markets, technologies and product capabilities
* develop products and enhancements
* release products and enhancements frequently
* develop and sustain operational environments for product use
* sustain and renew products.

Unlike traditional project management, Scrum is emphasized on people, an iterative process style, collaborative  and decentralized management style.

#### Benefits of Scrum in Software developent
Scrum is used in the development of software based on an iterative and incremental processes, it is used by software developers to move their projects quickly. There are numerous benefits of using Scrum in software development, they include;
* Collaboration : This helps the team to work together to create and validate the deliverables of the project. Collaboration occurs when the software developers work together to play off each other's input to produce something greater. Individuals working together are aware of each other's work and this helps to minimize the need for change, identify risk early and deal eith it efficiently, realize the true potential of the team and ensure continuous improvement through lesons learnt in collaboration. 

* Customer Satisfaction: The first and most important is getting delighted customers. In Scrum, sprints are really short so results are delivered and are ready for testing within 1-3 weeks. Scrum's main focus is to provide new features or corrections frequently, and 
collect feedback from clients as quick as possible. Therefore, Scrum speeds up bug fixing processes and the development of new features, 
making customers happy.

* High return on investment (ROI) : Scrum is built in a way that it ensures regular feedback through sprint reviews directly from stakeholders which include customers, this enables early correction which is less costly and time-consuming than later in the process, reduced costs of failure as it fails earlier compard to traditional method, srum all ensures decrease in time to market. All these are the reasons scrum projects realize a higher return on investment, beacause revenue and other targeted benefits start coming in sooner and earlier accumulation means higher total return over time.

*  Reduced risk: Scrum helps mitigate the risk of absolute project failure — spending large amounts of time and money with no return on 
investment — by delivering tangible product early and forcing scrum teams to fail early if they’re going to fail at all. Sprints help to 
ensure a short time between initial project investmnt and either failing fast or validating that a product or an approach will work. 
Effective communication and collaboration, constant feedback on products and processes also help to reduce risk.

* High Team Morale: Scrum ensures high tem morales, as self management puts decision that would normally be made by a manager or the 
organization into scrum team memebers; hands. Also, being part of a self managing and self organizing team allows people to be creative, 
innovative and acknowledged for their expertise, scrum teams also get to agree o rules about how they work to get the job done.

* Better quality of products: One of the principles of Scrum is value-based prioritization, scrum provides the framework for continual feedback and exposure to make sure that quality is as high as possible. Scrum practices such as; defining and elaborating requirements early so that knowledge of product features are relevant, daily testing and product owner feedback, regular and continous improvement of scrum team output through sprint reviews helps to ensure better qualities.

Just like any other methods, scrum has its disadvantages, however, it is very beneficiary to software development as it ensures better quality, low production cost, reduced risk, customer satisfaction and many more.

### Question 2 : From the agile manifesto, complete the following:
Individuals and interactions over **processes and tools**
Working software over **comprehensive documentation**
Customer collaboration over **contract negotiation**
Responding to change over **following a plan**
