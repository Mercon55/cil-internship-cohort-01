### UI/UX FUNDAMENTALS
UI/UX is mostly used interchangeable by people, but they are different.
UI or User Interface is the visual representation of a digital product. It's obvious use cases are apps and websites.
UI is the link between the user and the functionality of a product. It helps to achieve the desired outcome through a series of human-machine interactions. It's a series of text, shapes, graphics, and photographs combined in a way that allows for a fluid, natural interaction.

UX or User Experience on the other hand defines and studies how easy it is to use the product. With digital products, that means the interface, navigation patterns, and communications. The goal of UX is to allow the largest possible group of users the ability to understand and use a product. 

The role of a UI designer is the look & feel, while the role of a UX designer is defining how it will work.
UI is however a part of User Experience because readability and looks are also influencing the ease of use and shape our feelings towards a product.

## FUNDAMENTALS OF UI
Great UI is a sum of many parts. It is the interplay of colors, typography, interactions, layout, and style that requires a lot of work, 
experience, and imagination.
There are essential user interface design fundamentals that will help achieve exceptional result, they include:
 * User Interest : UI design is the link between users and product. Focusing on what the target users will like, will enable you to create an interface that is appealing and leads them to end goal. You have to understand what type of interface your target users will be attracted to, to motivate them.

* Communication and Feedback: Think of your interface as conversation with your user. Communicating with your user throughout every action by providing frequent feedback that validates their actions and nudges them along will go a long way.

* Visual Heirachy : A strong visual hierarchy is the crux of an aesthetically successful interface. Similarly to consistency, every screen, menu, and page should provide the same visual look and hierarchy. One of the most important design elements is reducing the appearance of complexity, regardless of how complex an action itself may be.

* Simplicity : Your UI design works best when it’s an invisible guide, and considered easy to use and simple by your target audience. When contemplating features or elements, always consider if it’ll enhance or diminish your users’ experience. Start with what’s absolutely essential and ensure that every feature has a purpose. Keep it simple.

* Attention to detail:
Precise design can be seen especially with low-importance elements still being created with care and attention to detail. Microinteraction while clicking on a checkbox, or a small X used to close a window should not be treated as an afterthought. Make even your terms and conditions screens beautiful, and the users will notice.

In as much as you might want to make your design unique, follow some simple rules that won't make you go out of the line. Remember, A good design is as little design as possible, unobstructive, environmental friendly, long-lasting and innovative.

## FUNDAMENTALS OF UX
* Readability : Ensure users will enjoy viewing or reading your design. Use the appropriate fonts, color, gradients etc.

* Accessibility :. Accessibility is about providing an experience which can be accessed by users with a full range of abilities—this includes those who are disabled in some respect, such as the hearing, vision, motion, or learning impaired.   Navigation is the key to attaining more visitor, ensure navigation is clear and unobtrusive.

* Usability : Usability is a crucial part of a product that shapes its UX. It matters because if users cannot achieve their goals efficiently, effectively and in a satisfactory manner, they are likely to seek an alternative solution to reach their goals. Usability is concerned with enabling users to achieve their end objective with a product effectively and efficiently.

* Credibility : Credibility relates to the ability of the user to trust in the product that you’ve provided—not just that
it does the job it is supposed to do, but also that it will last for a reasonable amount of time andthat the information provided with it is accurate and fit-for-purpose.

Always remember that a good UI/UX will determine the success of a product.
