# Question - Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model

## TCP/IP Model
**OSI model** helps to ensure effective communication between different computers/ architectures, they are based on layered structuring, and similar to the OSI model is the **TCP/IP model**.
TCP/IP (**Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol**) model is a communication protocols suite that is used for the majority of networks, it allows computers to communicate on a network such as the internet. 
TCP/IP is the most widely used communication protocols and it prepares and forward data packets over a network.
It is possible to separate TCP and IP, as they are two separate computer network protocols, IP is the part that obtains the address to which data is sent, while TCP is responsible for data delivery once the IP address has been found. There is no point separating them as they are often used together.

### How the TCP/IP model works
Message are broken down into packets, and are then reassembled on the other end. Interestingly, the packet could take a different route to the other computer, if the first route is unavailable or congested.
Similar to the OSI model, TCP/IP divides the different communication tasks into layers, where they all have different function to ensure that data is received on the other end of communication.
#### Layers of the TCP/IP model
* Application layer
* Transport layer
* Internet layer
* Data layer / Network interface layer

- **The application layer** consist of group of applications that require network communication, these applications let the users access the network. This is what the user typically interacts with, such as email and messaging. Because the lower layers handle the details of communication, the applications don’t need to concern themselves with this.

- **The transport layer** provides reliable data connection between two devices. Here, the TCP accepts data from the application layer, divides it into chunks and adds a TCP header, creating a TCP segment. Data are divided into packets and it is acknowledged that it has been received from the sender, and ensures the receiver acknowledges the packet it receives.

-  **The internet layer** controls the movement of packets around the network. It takes the segments from the transport layer and add in logical IP addressing for source and destination.

- **The  datalink layer** (also called the link layer, network interface layer, or physical layer) is what handles the physical parts of sending and receiving data using the Ethernet cable, wireless network, network interface card, device driver in the computer, and so on. The datalink layer also includes the technical infrastructure — such as the code that converts digital data into transmittable signals — that makes network connection possible.

The OSI and TCP/IP are really similar, they are both layered structured, ensuring communication between different devices. However, the TCP/IP consist of four layers while the OSI model consists of seven layers. TCP/IP is the implementation of the OSI model and it is protocol dependent. They both perform different functions but explains a well layerd structure where each layers contribute to ensure effective delivery of the work.
