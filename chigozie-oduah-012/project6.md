# Scrum Methodology 
This is a software development strategy that organizes team collaboration towards a common goal. It addresses the complexity in products making it easier to understand. The processes that makes up the scrum methodology include:

* The product owner creates a priority based wishlist of features called the _product backlog_.
* The team takes a piece of task from the the top of the list, plans its implementation and start a new _sprint_. A sprint usually lasts anywhere from a week to a month.
* They complete their task in a sprint and assess their progress in meetings called the _daily scrums_.
* At the end of the sprint, the product is ready for market. The sprint is ended with a review by the team. Then a either a new sprint begins or the project is completed and terminated.

## Benefits of Scrum
Some of the main advantages of using the Scrum Methodology are:
* __Boosts team morale:__
The team does not have a central controlling power so each individual has the freedom to be creative, innovative and acknowledhed for their expertise. They have a _ScrumMaster_ that shields them from external negative influence. The ScrumMaster does not control the team, they instead serve the team and keep them focused on the goal of the project.
* __Higher customer satisfaction:__
Custmers tend to get satisfied when they are given a usable portion of the product quicker. With that, they can test what they've received and give feedback. This is a very import factor in the overall success of the product. A new version of the product is created based on the customer's feedback. Scrum is designed for adaptability and to incorporate changes expenditiously making it easy to update the project's goals.
* __Project focus and goals are flexible:__
Scrum is suitable for a wide variety of situations that doesn't initially have clearly established requirements. Changes can be supported and integrated into a project currently in progress. In scrum the scope of the project is variable but the time and cost are constant. This is the major reason for the adaptability of a project using the Scrum methodology.
* __Quick creation of usable product:__
In Scrum, programmers start coding the product early and they do not have to wait until everything is crystal clear for them to start. And while they are developing the software the parts are done simultaneously rather than sequentially. This makes the product development process more than twice as fast as it would be if the coding is done one part after the other.
* __Higher return on investment:__
Decrease in the time to market the product, automation and upfront testing are the some benefits of scrum that leads to higher return on investment. It enables the revenue and the other benefits to start coming earlier than it would have been possible if we waited for the entire product to be completed before a release. An earlier accumulation results in higher total return over time.
