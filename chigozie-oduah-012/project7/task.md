* __The user experience of a blog site__ 
On the website there was a dialogue box at the bottom left corner of the screen covering almost half of the phone's screen. There is no obvious clue on how the dialog box could be closed. If the box is clicked it covers the screen and there is no btton to move back to the way it as before. The site had a bad user experience.

* __Purchasing an item in Jumia__
The user experience of buying an item in Jumia is good. It is a very intuitve process. To buy an item, you type the name of the item you want to buy in the search box on the top of the screen. The search results will appear below. Click on the item you want to purchase to see if it is the exact item. Then add it to the cart and finally checkout to purchase the item.

* __Contacting someone on WhatsApp__
On WhatsApp contacting someone is really easy and straight forward. You save the phone number of the person you want to contact. Then on the WhatsApp app you click on a new chat and click on the person's contact. You then click on either message or call to contact the person. It is a good user experince for someone used to other chattng apps. But, if it is your first time using a chatting application then it will take some asking questions to fully understand what to do. 

* __Installing apps from the IOS AppStore__
The AppStore's user experience searching for apps is simple. It is just to search for the app and then click on "Get". However, There is no app suggestion feature on the AppStore. So, if the user doesn't know what to install and just want to install an app or a game, they would not know what to do. And that is quite the bad experience.
