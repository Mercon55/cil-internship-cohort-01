# UI/UX Fundamentals
User experience (UX) is the series of events that occur when a person uses a product. UX design is the process of creating products that meets the user's needs and provide meaningful experiences to them. What UX designers do goes beyond UI designs. They take into account many things concerned with the entire process of acquiring and integrating products. Now, A user interface (UI) is a space where interaction between human and machine occurs. The goal of the UI is to make digital interactions ads effective, intuitive, fluid and efficient as possible at the user end. User Interface design is the design of a UI for machines and software with the focus of maximizing usability and user experience. The primary method used in UI design is prototyping and simulation.

## Core Principles
### Principles of UI design
All great user interfaces share some common characteristics, like: Clarity, Responsiveness, Consistency, Aesthetics, Efficiency, Forgiveness;

* __Clarity__: The interface should avoid ambiguity by making everything clear. This means that to design a good UI, the designer has to take into account things like the intuitiveness of the navigation, how clear the purpose of each element is, and how visible the items are, to make sure the product is as clear as possible.

* __Responsiveness__: A good user interface should provide informative feed back to the user about what's happening and whether their inputs are being processed. For example when a user is creating a password, your UI should give information on how strong the password should be and showing them how strong their password currently is.

* __Consistency__: A consistent UI is an interface that has similar design patterns, menus and screens throughout the interface. Keeping your UI designs consistent among your application is important to the user because it will be easy for them to recognize a usage pattern. Even if someone uses the interface for the first time, because the design is consistent, they can intuitively understand how to use it.

* __Aesthetics__: Making a UI look good will make the time the users spend using your application more enjoyable. Happier users results in loyal customers; which can only be a good thing to the brand.

* __Efficiency__: Great user interfaces should make the user more productive through shortcuts and good designs. Expert users and people who use your products frequently will need shortcuts to move quickly through the interface. An example of the short cuts most frequently used, easiest to memorize, very useful are 'Ctrl + v' and the 'Ctrl + c' for copying and pasting. They save a lot of time having to re-type what you see in a text or a website.

* __Forgiveness__: A good UI should not punish the user for their mistakes, but should instead provide means to solve the mistakes. What makes a great UI is an intuitive way to reverse the steps of the user when they have taken the wrong step.

### Principles of UX design
The characteristics of a good UX design are: empathy, strategy, usability, inclusivity and validation;

* __Empathy__: Quality UX designs put the user's needs first because without it, the UX designer will not understand how the product will solve the users problem effectively. Empathy is the key to a successful product. With empathy, designers are able to put themselves in the shoes of the user and learn what expectations they have interacting with the product, What problems they need solved, and what a good experience will look like to the user.

* __Strategy__: An important part of UX design is having a well-defined plan and goals before starting the project because designing effective solutions to difficult problems can be a complex process. Many designers will come up with a strategy that outlines a variety of UX objectives. While this is important to follow, a UX strategy is not unchangeable and may be amended during the design process.

* __Usability__: A big part of UX design is making product that are simple and intuitive to the user no matter what age they are in or what abilities they have. To do this, designer take into account things like behavioural psychology and mental models when designing the product.

* __Inclusivity__: UX designers have the power to solve complex problems. So their design efforts should take into account all the different needs of prople of different ages, sexes, races, and social status. Inclusive designs ensures that the product being designed will be able to fit in a diverse population.

* __Validation__: One of the most important aspect of UX design is testing the created solutions with the users that will be using it in real life. User feedback guides and informs the design process and helps ensures that the product being made are ones people will happily want to use. Even after the products are released, the designers are constantly using methods to assess the products' success and to search for where improvements can be made.

## Benefits
### Benefits of UI design

* __Acquisition of new customers__: A great UI contributes so much to the user experience. In this way it can attract new customers and dramatically increase sales of the product. Investing in UI design will enhance business and maximize business opportunity. 

* __Increased customer engagement__: The development of a UI to better navigate and simplify usage not only attracts new users but also makes them want to continue their digital experience. A well-designed interface encourages user engagement, which leads to them becoming more loyal to the brand.

* __Lower development costs__: A well-planned design from the start prevents future problems. This includes training needs and interface support. All this involves much costs, so the user-friendly UI benefits not only the users but also the businesses as it causes fewer problems to the users and avoids additional costs.

* __Increased productivity__: Delivering the best user interface while minimizing costs and resources in what is essential leads to a rise in both the brand and the user productivity.

* __Lower customer support costs__: Usually, users express some difficulties when navigating an interface. But, if the UI is intuitive, the user will not have those difficulties and their contact with the support service will be less frequent. This way a company benefits from reducing costs in customer support. An intuitive interface minimizes the occurrences of difficulties, errors and unwanted action.

### Benefits of UX design
UX designers are a priceless addition to a wide range of industries. They are not limited to digital interfaces alone.

* __Attraction of new customers__: A good UX is responsible for customer attraction and retention. A UI that fulfills a customer's needs is most likely to convert the customer. In designing products, the UX designer creates description of people who will potentially use the app. This allows the UX designer to get a better feel for the target audience and create user experience that motivates the end users to continue using the product

* __Increase in productivity__: Businesses may hire UX designers to help streamline business processes or re-design employee software to a more easier and efficient design. Delivering the best experience possible in the products leads to a rise in both the company productivity. With an intuitive navigation, the user decreases the time they'll spend searching for a solutions and speed up the fulfillment of their needs

* __Increase in company revenue__: With a good UX design customers judgement based on their experience with the product the first time they use it, will be very good. And for that reason, they are most likely going to be loyal to the company, thereby, increasing the company's revenue.



# Differences between UI and UX
While UI and UX have some similarities and are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the same thing. They are almost completely different, some of the list of differences are:

* UI designers focus on the design patterns of the product, while UX designers focus on creating a product that solves a problem.

* UX design can be used for a wide variety of things outside digital interfaces, while UI designs are limited to the interface.

* UI is what the user sees and UX is what the user experiences while using the product.

* UI designers think so much about how best to make the product appealing to the user, while UX designers think so much about how best to make the product easy to use.
