# TCP/IP Model
The TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) is a model that is used to determine how a computer
should be connected to the internet, it helps in connecting computers together over large distances. 
It is developed in the 1970s by the US Department of Defence (DoD). 

# Layered Processes
This model contains 4 layered processes, The:
* Application layer,
* Transport layer,
* Network layer, and
* Link layer.

## Application Layer:
The application layer is the first layer from the sending side. It does the same work as the Application,
Presentation, and Session layer of the OSI model. Protocols in this layer includes the HTTP and HTTPS
(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol - Secure), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), Telnet, SSH (Secure Shell), NTP (Network Time
Protocol), and so on.

## Transport Layer:
This layer is analogous to the transport layer in the OSI model. It handles the end-to-end commulication and ensures
that the data delivered to the receiving end. The TCP and the UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are the two main
protocols in this layer.

## Network Layer:
The function of this layer is correspondent to the OSI's network layer. It defines the protocols that handles the
transmizzion of data over the whole network. The main protocols include IP, ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol).

## Link Layer:
The combination of the data link layer and the physical layer's function in the OSI is similar to this layer. This 
layer looks out for hardware addresses and the protocols present in the system. It also handles the physical 
transmission of data to the network.
