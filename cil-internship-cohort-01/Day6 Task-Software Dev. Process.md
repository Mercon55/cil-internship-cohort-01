# SCRUM
Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. Scrum is also a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. It is a widely used subset of agile software development. The word scrum also is used in rugby to define a play where players struggle against each to gain possession of the ball. 
Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems. It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience.  While scrum is most frequently used by software development teams, its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of teamwork. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.

Scrum focuses on smaller, fixed-length iterations. Once the time period for a sprint is finalized, the stories or product backlog entries that can be implemented during this sprint cycle are then determined. Scrum has several categorical concepts enforced as part of its implementation such as sprint review, retrospective, daily scrum, etc. It also insists on cross-functionality, which is the ability of a scrum team to not depend on external members to achieve their goals. Its semi-prescriptive approach actually helps remove the ambiguities in the development process, while giving sufficient space for companies to introduce their individual flavor to it.Scrum’s success in developing complex hardware and software products across diverse industries and verticals makes it a compelling framework to adopt for an organization.


# BENEFITS OF SCRUM IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

* BETTER PRODUCT QUALITY: You will have better product quality if you’re checking in with your customers and stakeholders for evolving requirements during sprint reviews because they will be able to determine more quickly whether the software matches their needs. Sprints are the time-boxed cadence of the Scrum framework. Each sprint produces a product that is ready for market even though the project is ongoing. The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be on the market.

* HIGHER RETURN INVESTMENT AND FASTER (ROI): Faster ROI comes from delivering quality products that the customers can use in a shorter time frame. Early and regular feedback that prompts course corrections early when they are less costly. Take TurboTax, rather than focus on software for all states and federal income at once, like a waterfall project might do, they break it down.  At the end of each Sprint, they would have the chance for customer feedback on that product. Building out one state’s tax software at a time allows them to get their product into the hands of customers and start earning money earlier. 

* IMPROVED CUSTOMER SATISFACTION: Business Value are Customer Satisfaction are two big wins with Scrum. This is due to the fact that you have the potential for delivering real value in as quickly as two weeks! Features and enhancements are driven much more by customers in Scrum which ultimately leads to a better product. Another win stemming from regular customer engagement in the process is that customers feel deeply involved with the product - and even champion it - because they are helping to build it. This makes Scrum development a winner for both improved business value and customer satisfaction.  

* The incremental process shortens the time to market by about 30 percent to 40 percent. Because the product owner is part of the scrum team, requirements can be delivered as they are needed.



# From the Agile Manifesto,complete the following:

* Individuals and interactions over "PROCESSES AND TOOLS"S
* Working software over "COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION"
* Customer collaboration over "CONTRACT NEGOTIATION"
* Responding to change over "FOLLOWING A PLAN"
