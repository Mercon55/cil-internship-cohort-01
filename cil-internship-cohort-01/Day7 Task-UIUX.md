# Tutorial Questions:

## Task 1
* WHATSAPP FOR APP
WhatsApp is a free, multiplatform messaging app that lets you make video and voice calls, send text messages, send voice note, upload pictures on your profile/status and with other amazing features. WhatsApp is especially popular among friends and family who live in different countries and want to stay in touch
Using WhatsApp, it was easy to accomplish some of my goals. However, when you want to upload a picture straight from your gallery, it reduces the quality of the picture from what it was originally when you snapped the picture using a phone camera. This frustrated me and makes me question why the picture quality of the app is so bad and not improved even with the updates that comes with the app.

## Task 2
As a Frontend developer, I always work closely with UX designers to reach the end goal of the design. This is very similar to what a  UX researcher does or what is done in the Design to development hand-off phase.

## Task 3
Elizabeth Johnson 
Popularly known as Barbie on Instagram is a UI/UX influencer.  She uploads designs on how to improve, grow and how to start a career as a UI/UX designer
I can categorize her as a UI/UX designer

## Task 4
I am a UI/UX designer. What I do majorly is provide the best experience for users by solving their problems and making their experience seamless. I do this by conducting user research, wireframes, visual designs, prototype and constant user testing.
Compared to other designers,
*	UI/UX design is more extensive and incorporates other design field. 
*	Compared to graphics design, UI/Ux is more than just aesthetics and careful considerations are used for each design decisions. 
*	We often find other design fields in UI/Ux design e.g Graphics design, Motion design etc. 
*	Other design field have little or no screen interactions.

## Task 5
Sandra
She is a UI/UX designer and from her portfolio you can deduce the use of UI/UX elements. From her visuals, prove that you can add more relevance to your thinking process and that more come be done than just images and text

## Task 6
UI/UX design roadmap.
The soft skills I gathered so far are:
*	Visual Communication skills
*	Organization skills
*	Empathy
The hard skill I gathered so far are:
*	User research
*	Responsive Web Design 
*	Prototyping and Wireframing

To master these skills I must spend at least 5 hours daily learning, researching and constantly executing what I learned.
Also I will take more online courses to help fast track my growth.

The market is currently getting saturated with UI/UX designers however there are lot of avialable opportunities. I intend to transition into a UI developer. This will help me stay relevant and help me achieve my goals.



# FUNDAMENTALS OF UI/UX DESIGN

* WHAT IS UI DESIGN
User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms—e.g., voice-controlled interfaces. UI design is a craft where you the designer build an essential part of the user experience. 

* WHAT IS UX DESIGN
User experience (UX) is the relationship between a product and the person using it. UX design focuses on building products that someone can easily use and enjoy using. User experience (UX) is the series of events that occur when that person actually uses the product, digital interface, or service. And UX design is the process of discovering user needs and designing solutions to meet them.

* DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UI/UX DESIGN
1. UI design creates combination of typography, colour palettes, buttons, animations and imagery while UX design creates structural design solutions for pain points that users encounter along their journey with the product.
2. UI design results in product that delight users aesthetically while UX design resuilts in products that delight users with their effectiveness.
3. UI design focus on visual touchpoints that allow users to interact with a product while UX design focus on the full experience from a user's first contact to the last.
4. UI design application is digital products only while UX design application is physical and digital products.

* PRINCIPLES OF UI/UX DESIGN
1. Empathy: Quality UX design puts users’ needs at the forefront of product development. To understand the user and what obstacles they face, UX designers must practice empathic design. With empathy, designers are able to put themselves in the user’s shoes and learn about their daily life, what problems they need solved, what expectations they have when interacting with certain products, and what a good experience looks like to them.
2. Usability: In a world of rapidly advancing and sometimes confusing technology, consumers often lean towards products that take little brain power to operate. A big part of UX design is making products and services that are simple and intuitive to use for people of all ages and abilities. To do this, designers take into account things like behavioral psychology, accessibility, affordances, and mental models when designing for optimal and effortless usability.
3. Inclusivity: A common phrase you may hear in the UX industry is “design for all”—meaning that our design efforts should take into account the needs of people of all races, ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and more. UX designers have the ability to shape the world around them through their designs and the power to solve complex problems that affect a wide range of individuals. Inclusive design ensures a variety of voices are being heard when designing for diverse populations.
4. Strategy: Many designers will craft a UX strategy that outlines a variety of UX objectives including chosen research methods, preferred design and testing systems, and what success looks like for both the user and the business. Designing effective solutions to difficult problems can be a complex process. Therefore, a crucial part of UX design is having a well-defined plan and set of goals before starting any project.
5. Validation: One of the most crucial aspects of UX design is to test proposed solutions with the people who will actually be using them in real life. However impressive a design may seem, it would mean nothing if not validated by user testing. User feedback guides and informs the design process and helps ensure that the products being made are ones people will happily want to use. 

* WHAT UI/UX DESIGNERS DO
1. Empathize: Empathy is key—and user research is essential to finding that understanding and connection to your users’ needs and goals. So the first step is to conduct extensive  and inclusive research about the people who will be interacting with the product. 
2. Define: After they’ve come to understand their users needs and goals, UX designers figure out and define what problems need solving, and set direct guidelines for the tasks ahead. Once designers have a comprehensive idea of their users, they’ll present their findings in the form of a user persona—an archetypical person that represents the needs and behaviors of the larger population. They may also come up with a user journey map to visually represent the ideal customer experience. Designers may also collaborate with their design teams and come up with an effective approach to creating design solutions.
3. Ideate: This stage often happens recursively throughout the defining, prototyping, and even testing stages—you discover user needs and your imagination starts coming up with ways to solve those problems. But skilled UX designers also know how to come up with ideas in systematic ways. There are also a wide variety of design thinking exercises that help UX designers (and the people they collaborate with) to generate innovative and delightful solutions to design problems.
4. Prototype: Now, it’s time to put pen to paper and start designing. Designers create mockups and prototypes to initially test their ideas to make sure they’ll actually work as intended. This is the phase that most people think of when it comes to UX design as it involves the actual creation of the product or service. 
5. Test: No UX design process is complete without testing your design solutions to ensure that they’ll actually work the way you intend. Designers will observe their users interact with their designs and ask them to complete certain tasks or sort information. After testing, designers compile the data, analyze it, and determine what improvements need to be made.
6. Iterate: With each cycle of the design process, designers take what they’ve learned from previous ones and address new problems, make meaningful improvements, and design more effective solutions. The UX design process is a cyclical one meaning that once the designs have been created and user feedback has been obtained, it’s time to repeat the steps again.
