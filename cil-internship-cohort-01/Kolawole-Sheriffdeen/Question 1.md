## TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP stand for Transmission Control  Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocol used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP defines how application can create channel of commucication across a network. And also the IP define how to address and route each packet to make sure it reaches the right destination. TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packats, addresswd, tramitted, routed and received at the destination

# HOW THE TCP/ip WORK

Collectively, the TCP/IP suite of protocol is classied as stateless, which means each client request is considered new because it is unrelated to previous request. Being tateless frees up network pahs so they can be used continionly.TCP/IP uses the client-server model of communication in which a user or machine(a client) is privided a service,like send a webpage, by another computer (a server) in the network. TCP/IP uses the client-server model of communication in which a user or machine (a client)  is provided a service,like sending a webpage ,by another computer (a server) in the network

TCP/IP and OSI models are most wodely used communication networking protocols. The main similarity is the way theya re construsted as the both layers, although TCP/IP consists of just 4 layers, while the OSI model consist of the seven layers

# THE FOUR LAYERS OF THE TCP/IP MODELS

* Application layer
* Transport Layer
* Network Layer
* Physical Layer
