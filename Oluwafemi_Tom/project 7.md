- UI/UX?

UI design is the processing of designing the visual and interactive properties of a visual experience, ensuring the interface is both clear for the user to navigate and overall aesthetically pleasing.

UX design on the other hand is the art of carefully curating the experience a user will have when interacting with a certain product or service. It is process of creating products and experiences that help the user to seamlessly interact with your product and achieve the desired result.

The difference between User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) is that 

UI refers to the aesthetic elements by which people interact with a product, while UX is about the experience a user has with a product or service.
