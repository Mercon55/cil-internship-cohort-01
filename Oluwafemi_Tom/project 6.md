- SCRUM?
Scrum is an agile methdology employed in the software product development process based on an iterative and incremental process. It helps the team work collaboratively together to achieve a common goal. It is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining products in a complex environment, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies.

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problem.
 Scrum software development starts with a wish list of features.
**Scrum relies on an agile software development concept called sprints.**
   + Sprints are periods of time when software development is actually done.
   + A sprint usually lasts from one week to one month to complete an item from the backlog.
   + The goal of each sprint is to create a saleable product.
   + Each sprint ends with a sprint review.
   + Then the team chooses another piece of backlog to develop â€” which starts a new sprint.
   + Sprints continue until the project deadline or the project budget is spent.

**In software development, three roles are defined in the scrum framework:**
 The **scrum team** does the work. It is the individuals who are working together in the sprints to produce the products.
 The **scrum master** is part of the scrum team makes sure the team works in compliance with the scrum rules. This is not a manager.
 The **product owner** represents the customer. This role prioritizes the backlog and coordinates the scrum teamwork. 
The product owner is a role similar to project manager in more traditional project management frameworks.

Some of the benefits of scrum in software developent includes:

* Ensures a swift delivery of useable products to users and customers.
* Encourages ownership of product for team members as they have freedom to make decisions on how to implement the product.
* Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.
* A higher ROI is realized from the product due to reduced costs, decreased marketing time etc.

**...Agile Manifesto:**

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
1. Working software over comprehensive documentation.
1. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
1. Responding to change over following a plan.
