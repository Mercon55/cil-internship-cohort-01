#(SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS)

##SCRUM

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. Scrum is simple.  It is the opposite of a big collection of interwoven mandatory components. Scrum is not a methodology. Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems. Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. It is a widely used subset of agile development. 
In a rugby scrum, all the players literally put their heads together. When it comes to software development, a scrum can be characterized by developers putting their heads together to address complex problems.

##BENEFITS OF SCRUM IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
>1.More relevant metrics: The metrics that scrum teams use to estimate time and cost, measure project performance, and make project decisions are often more relevant and more accurate than metrics on traditional projects. Using relative estimates, rather than hours or days, tailors estimated effort to an individual development team’s knowledge and capabilities. At the end of every sprint, a product owner can compare the project’s actual cost (AC) plus the opportunity cost of future projects (OC) against the value that the current project is returning (V) to know when to terminate a project and begin a new one. You don’t need to wait until the end of a project to know what its value is.
>2. Improved progress visibility and exposure: On scrum projects, every member of the project team (which includes the scrum team and stakeholders) has the opportunity to know how the project is going at any given time. Transparency and visibility make scrum an exposure model to help the project team accurately identify issues and more accurately predict how things will go as the project progresses.  Daily scrums around task boards enable developers to self-organize and identify the highest-priority tasks for the day.
>3. Increased project control: Adjusting priorities throughout the project at each sprint interval rather than at major milestones allows the organization to have fixed-time and fixed-price projects while accommodating change.  Sprint reviews let project stakeholders see working products and provide product owners the feedback they need to ensure that the project stays on track. Sprint retrospectives enable the scrum team to make informed course adjustments at the end of every sprint to enhance product quality, increase development team performance, and refine project processes.
>4. Reduced risk: Having the highest-risk items done first provides the longest runway to work through issues or fail early and inexpensively. Having a working product increment starting with the very first sprint, so that even if a project gets terminated, the highest-value and risk requirements have been developed and could be delivered to the customer if desired.
>5. Higher customer satisfaction: Collaborating with customers as partners and keeping customers involved and engaged throughout projects. Demonstrating working functionality to internal stakeholders and customers in every sprint review. Delivering product to end customers faster and more often with every release rather than all at once at the very end.
