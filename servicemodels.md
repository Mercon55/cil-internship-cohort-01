# What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is the on demand availability and  delivery of computer system resources, including servers, databases, networking, software, analytics, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user.

It is a model for managing, storing and processing data online via the internet. 

### The three delivery models for cloud computing are:
- Software as a Service
- Platform as a Service 
- Infrastructure as a service

## Software as a Service - SaaS
Software as a Service - SaaS is a service model that offers on demand, pay-per-use of application software to users. It is platform independent and the software does not need to be installed on the PC. The cloud runs a single instance of the software and makes it available to multiple end users. 

SaaS is a way of delivering applications over the Internet—as a service. Instead of installing and maintaining software, you simply access it via the Internet, freeing yourself from complex software and hardware management.

Software as a Service now accounts for 24% of all enterprise IT workloads. SaaS platforms provide software accessibility to users, without installation, over the internet, in return for a subscription fee often based on a monthly pricing model. 

Everything is available via an online account and accessible from any device with an internet connection. Different members of an organisation can access variations of the software per their relevant access status. 

In other words, businesses no longer need IT specialists, to manage multiple computing software instances. With SaaS, everything happens on the cloud and is managed and maintained by your external service provider for a fixed cost, improving user experience. 

Basic software can be set up in a matter of hours, but the service is scalable to larger, enterprise-level business needs as well. SaaS is ideal for businesses seeking minimal IT input and the peace of mind that a professional team is available for support.  

SaaS applications are sometimes called Web-based software, on-demand software, or hosted software. Whatever the name, SaaS applications run on a SaaS provider’s servers. The provider manages access to the application, including security, availability, and performance.

SaaS offers a variety of advantages over traditional software licensing models. Because the software does not live on the licensing company’s servers, there is less demand for the company to invest in new hardware.

It is easy to implement, easy to update and debug, and can be less expensive (or at least have lower up-front costs) since users pay for SaaS as they go instead of purchasing multiple software licenses for multiple computers.

Types of software that have migrated to a SaaS model are often focused on enterprise-level services, such as human resources. These types of tasks are often collaborative in nature, requiring employees from various departments to share, edit, and publish material while not necessarily in the same office.

### Characteristics of SaaS
- Multitenant Architecture
A multitenant architecture, in which all users and applications share a single, common infrastructure and code base that is centrally maintained. Because SaaS vendor clients are all on the same infrastructure and code base, vendors can innovate more quickly and save the valuable development time previously spent on maintaining numerous versions of outdated code.

- Easy Customisation
The ability for each user to easily customise applications to fit their business processes without affecting the common infrastructure. Because of the way SaaS is architected, these customisations are unique to each company or user and are always preserved through upgrades. That means SaaS providers can make upgrades more often, with less customer risk and much lower adoption cost.
Better Access
Improved access to data from any networked device while making it easier to manage privileges, monitor data use, and ensure everyone sees the same information at the same time.

### Cases where SaaS is used and who uses SaaS

SaaS has numerous applications, including:

- Email services
- Auditing functions
- Automating sign-up for products and services
- Managing documents, including file sharing and document collaboration
- Shared company calendars, which can be used for scheduling events.
- Customer relationship management (CRM) systems, which are essentially a database of client and prospect information. SaaS-based CRMs can be used to hold company contact information, business activity, products purchased as well as track leads.

Some use cases for SaaS include web scraping, implementing SEO strategies for increasing web traffic, and link building for companies.

End customers are frequent users of SaaS. There are SaaS applications for fundamental business applications such as sales management, customer relationship management (CRM), financial management, human resource management (HRM), billing and collaboration.


### Examples of SaaS
- Netflix
- Shopify
- Dropbox.
- Salesforce.
- Cisco WebEx


## Platform as a Service- PaaS
PaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, is a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete cloud platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure—for developing, running, and managing applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility that often comes with building and maintaining that platform on-premises.

PaaS is also a cloud computing solution where the service provider delivers a platform to clients via a subscription model. By paying a monthly or yearly fee, clients get access to a platform that enables them to develop, manage, and run applications without creating and managing the infrastructure for them. The provider hosts both hardware and software, thus freeing you from installing and handling that in-house.

This is mainly a development environment and is made of up a programming language execution environment, an operating system, a web server and a database. This encapsulates the environment where users can build, compile, and run their programs without worrying of the underlying infrastructure. In this model, the user manages the data and the application resources, all other resources are managed by the vendor. 

It allows for easy deployment of web applications, faster market for developers, it is also cost effective and allows for rapid development, hence it is scalable. Private or public deployment is possible.

PaaS usually includes multiple essential services, like application hosting or Java development. Some PaaS solutions entail design, development, testing, and deployment of applications. Other services can be web service integration, database integration, team collaboration, and security. All of this is owned, configured, operated, and maintained by the service provider. This relieves the clients’ IT departments of a heavy administrative burden and operational burden while presenting an attractive financial setup.

PaaS tools offer an excellent vehicle for entering the cloud era and starting to leverage scalable services – while at the same time spending less.

In general, PaaS solutions have three main parts:

- Cloud infrastructure including virtual machines (VMs), operating system software, storage, networking, firewalls

- Software for building, deploying and managing applications

- A graphic user interface, or GUI, where development or DevOps teams can do all their work throughout the entire application lifecycle

Because PaaS delivers all standard development tools through the GUI online interface, developers can log in from anywhere to collaborate on projects, test new applications, or roll out completed products. Applications are designed and developed right in the PaaS using middleware. With streamlined workflows, multiple development and operations teams can work on the same project simultaneously.

PaaS providers manage the bulk of your cloud computing services, such as servers, runtime and virtualization.

### Cases where PaaS is used and Who uses PaaS

Developers mostly use PaaS. It is useful in the following cases:

1) API Development and Management
PaaS is useful for companies that develop, run, and manage app programming interfaces and microservices. This also goes for the development of new APIs and end-to-end API management.

2) Business Intelligence and Analytics
PaaS tools allow for advanced analysis of business data, to identify patterns, make predictions, and ultimately make more qualified and data-driven decisions. PaaS tools can help companies predict behaviors and events so that they’re able to plan better.

3) Databases and Data Management
PaaS is suitable for setting up and managing an organization’s database. PaaS provides a scalable, secure, and on-demand platform for creating, administering, and maintaining databases. As research firm Forrester puts it: “The shift to the cloud for big data is on.”

4) Communication and Collaboration
One of the great things about PaaS is that it can be a delivery mechanism for communication and collaboration. This means that features like voice, chat, and videos can be added to applications built on the PaaS.

5) Worker Systems
A worker system is an essential part of any production-scale cloud application. The ability to run tasks in the background, process tasks at scale, or schedule jobs to run on regular schedules is crucial for handling the types of workloads and processing demands typical in a distributed application. The Ironworker platform is an example of PaaS making life easier for users.

6) Internet of Things
With the explosive growth in IoT (Internet of Things), PaaS will play an increasingly important role. PaaS supports various programming languages, application environments, and tools, allowing for the connectivity and integrations needed in IoT deployments.


### Examples of PaaS
- AWS Elastic BeanStalk
- Heroku
- Google app engine 
- Windows Azure
- Apache Stratos


## Infrastructure as a Service- IaaS
IaaS is on-demand access to cloud-hosted computing infrastructure - servers, storage capacity and networking resources - that customers can provision, configure and use in much the same way as they use on-premises hardware. The difference is that the cloud service provider hosts, manages and maintains the hardware and computing resources in its own data centers. IaaS customers use the hardware via an internet connection, and pay for that use on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.

Typically IaaS customers can choose between virtual machines (VMs) hosted on shared physical hardware (the cloud service provider manages virtualization) or bare metal servers on dedicated (unshared) physical hardware. Customers can provision, configure and operate the servers and infrastructure resources via a graphical dashboard, or programmatically through application programming interfaces (APIs).

This service offers the computing architecture, and infrastructure, all computing resources but must be in a virtual environment so that mutiple users can access them. The resources includes: data storage, virtualization, servers and networking. 

IaaS businesses offer services such as pay-as-you-go storage, networking, and virtualization.

IaaS gives users cloud-based alternatives to on-premise infrastructure, so businesses can avoid investing in expensive on-site resources.

Most vendors are responsible for managing the resources above, however users will be responsible for handling other resources such as Application, data, runtime and middleware. 

IaaS is flexible and support dynamic workloads.

### Cases where IaaS are used and who uses IaaS
System Administrators are the ones that mostly use this service.

- Disaster recovery: Instead of setting up redundant servers in multiple locations, IaaS can deploy its disaster recovery solution to the cloud provider's existing geographically-dispersed infrastructure.

- Ecommerce: IaaS is an excellent option for online retailers that frequently see spikes in traffic. The ability to scale up during periods of high demand and high-quality security are essential in today’s 24-7 retail industry.

- Internet of Things (IoT), event processing, artificial intelligence (AI): IaaS makes it easier to set up and scale up data storage and computing resources for these and other applications that work with huge volumes of data.

- Startups: Startups can't afford to sink capital into on-premises IT infrastructure. IaaS gives them access to enterprise-class data center capabilities without the up-front investment in hardware and management overhead.

- Software development: With IaaS, the infrastructure for testing and development environments can be set up much more quickly than on-premises. (However, this use case is better suited to PaaS, as you'll read in the next section.)
