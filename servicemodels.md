## Cloud Service Models

Cloud computing is offered in three different service models, which each satisfy a unique set of business requirements. These three main models are known as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Other models are known as Identity as a Service(IDaaS),  Function as a Service(FaaS) and Network as a Service(NaaS).


### Software as a service
The Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model enables the delivery of software applications to end users as a service. It refers to software that is hosted on a server and is accessible over the Internet. This would be a software application that you could access over the cloud without having to have it installed on your device. SaaS is a fully-developed software solution ready for purchase and use over the internet on a subscription basis. SaaS applications allow companies to get up and running very quickly as well as scale operations rapidly. There’s no need to purchase or deploy the hardware and software used to deliver their business services. Even sophisticated enterprise-level applications, such as customer relationship management (CRM) or enterprise resource planning (ERP) programs, can be easily accessed by the smallest organizations, providing them with tools that allow them to grow their businesses more effectively than ever.

Some of the characteristics of SaaS model includes:

- Software as a service (SaaS) makes software available through the Internet.

- The vendor is in charge of maintaining the software programs.

- The software license may be subscription-based or usage-based. It is also billed on a recurrent basis.

- SaaS apps are cost-effective since they do not require end-user maintenance.

- They are provided on a first-come, first-served basis.

- They may be scaled up or down in response to demand.

- They are upgraded and updated automatically.

- SaaS provides a common data model. As a result, several users can access a single instance of infrastructure. Individual user functionality does not need to be hardcoded.

- The program is the same version for all users.

##### Popular examples of computing services that use SaaS are:
A variety of services are available as Software as a Service, including file storage, backup, web-based email and project management tools. Using one of these applications, users can access, share, store and secure information in the cloud. SaaS cloud solutions examples include Dropbox, Slack, Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, Cisco WebEx, and Google Apps.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Platform as a service is an environment in the cloud where developers can build and deploy apps. PaaS provides the database and operating system that is needed to develop cloud-based software. Developers can focus on their task, without needing to build and maintain the infrastructure that such software development processes normally require. PaaS helps in the application’s rapid development as developers focus only on code and leaving infrastructure headaches to the provider. Platform-as-a-Service provides the application runtime environment. It also provides the development and deployment tools needed to create applications. PaaS provides point-and-click tools that allow non-developers to construct web apps.

PaaS is a bit more specialized. Rather than pure infrastructure, PaaS provides the framework needed to build, test, deploy, manage, and update software products. It utilizes the same basic infrastructure as IaaS, but it also includes the operating systems, middleware, development tools, and database management systems needed to create software applications.

PaaS is extremely helpful for any company that develops software and web-based applications. Many of the tools needed to develop for multiple platforms (computers, mobile devices, browsers, etc) can be quite expensive. By using PaaS, customers can access the development tools they need, when they need them, without having to purchase them outright.


##### Popular examples of computing services that use PaaS are:
PaaS providers offer applications such as  AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure (also IaaS), Google App Engine, Jelastic, and Apache Stratos. 

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
IaaS is the most comprehensive and flexible type of cloud service available. Essentially, it provides a completely virtualized computing infrastructure that is provisioned and managed over the internet. An IaaS provider manages the physical end of the infrastructure (servers, data storage space, etc) in a data center, but allows customers to fully customize those virtualized resources to suit their specific needs.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service provides access to fundamental resources such as physical machines, virtual machines, virtual storage, etc. Apart from these resources, the IaaS also offers:

- Virtual machine disk storage
- Virtual local area network (VLANs)
- Load balancers
- IP addresses
- Software bundles

All of the above resources are made available to end user via server virtualization. Moreover, these resources are accessed by the customers as if they own them. Infrastructure as a service provides the infrastructure that you need to manage SaaS tools, including servers, storage, and networking resources. The cloud provider would manage the storage servers and networking hardware and may also offer additional services like load balancing and firewalls.
Infrastructure as a service offers a standardized way of acquiring computing capabilities on demand and over the web. Such resources include storage facilities, networks, processing power, and virtual private servers.

IaaS eliminates the capital expense of building up in-house infrastructure. It’s a great option for small companies and startups that don’t have the resources to purchase the hardware and software needed to create their own network internally. It also takes the day-to-day burdens of managing computing infrastructure off the hands of IT departments, freeing them to focus on core business drivers instead of troubleshooting. Since the IaaS provider continuously updates their system with the latest software and update patches, it’s easier to get new programs and applications up and running. IaaS provides the latest in security protections and usually offers services like disaster recovery to go along with their uptime reliability SLAs.


##### Popular examples of computing services that use IaaS are:
Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Metacloud, Virtual Machines (VMs), and Google Compute Engine (GCE).


## Function as a Service (FaaS)

FaaS, also known as serverless computing, enables users to run code in real time rather than allocating processing resources ahead of time. The infrastructure is handled by the cloud provider, allowing the user to concentrate solely on deploying application code. Functions automatically scale, making them an ideal fit for dynamic workloads with fluctuating resource use. Customers only pay for the resources they use, making FaaS the most realistic "pay-as-you-go" cloud computing model.
  
The majority of FaaS apps are fairly simple and can be implemented rapidly. The cloud client only has to upload the completed function code and instruct the platform on how to allocate resources when it runs. New instances of the function may be created on demand, and the function consumes no resources when it is idle. The main disadvantage of FaaS is the execution time.


##### Popular examples of computing services that use FaaS are:
Examples of FaaS: AWS Lambdas, Azure Functions.
