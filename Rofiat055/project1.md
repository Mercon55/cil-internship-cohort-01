# OSI Model

<p>One of the processes i am familiar with similar to the OSI model will be washing of plenty plate in the sink

<p>At first the plate is well clean and arranged on the plate rack before it been use to eat and pile up in the sink</p>

* The plate clean and ready to use is the application layer.
* Using it to eat is the Presentation layer.
* The plate is been pile up in the sink, so you have to sort it out before washing is session layer.
* Washing and rinsing is the transportation and networking layer.
* Towel drying and cleaning is the data link layer.
* Arranging back to the plate rack is the physical layer.


**Application:** Human-computer interaction layer, where applications can access the network services eg google chrome.<br>
**Presentation:** Ensures that data is in a usable format and is where data encryption occurs.<br>
**Session:** Mantains connections and is responsible for controlling ports and sessions.<br>
**Transport:** Transmits data using transmisison protocols including TCP and UDP.<BR>
**Network:** Decides which physical path the data will take.<br>
**Data link:** Defines the format of data on the network.<br>
**Physical:** Transmitd raw bit stream over the physical medium.<br>
