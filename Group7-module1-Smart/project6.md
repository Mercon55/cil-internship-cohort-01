# What I understand by Scrum

Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. It is a widely used subset of agile software development.
The word scrum also is used in rugby to define a play where players struggle against each to gain possession of the ball. The goal of a scrum in software development is to perform at a high-performing level like a rugby team does in a scrum.

## Benefits of Scrum in software development

Scrum works and results in higher productivity and lower costs in large part for the reasons listed below:

* Faster time to market because of the more efficient way to incorporate changes, and since useable segments of business value are released when done and not first at the end of the project which could be many months later.
* Higher quality because of on-going testing and debugging and such techniques as pair programming.
* Better individual team morale due to to the members identifying to the project as their own as well as from gaining increased technical knowledge due to pair programming.
* Improved “stakeholder” satisfaction due to being involved in the project as it is
* progressing along and by being able to give feedback to the team as they begin to
implement segments of completed work released for their use.

## Agile Manifesto

* Individual and interactions over processes and tools.
* Working software over comprehensive documentation.
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
* Responding to change over following a plan.
