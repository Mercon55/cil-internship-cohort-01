LAYERED PROCESS SIMILAR TO OSI MODEL

I will be describing the layered process i am familiar with using my School Organogram as a case study.

The process i took when doing my final clearance as a student.

- You get the clearance form from the Student affairs Unit.
- You go to your department where your records will be accessed and if your clear, The HOD signs on the form
- Then it moves to your faculty, where the Dean will Sign.
- Then it goes back to student affairs where the student affairs Dean will verify the two signatures(HOD and faculty Dean)and then signs.
- It now moves to the medical department where the Doctor will sign.
- Then it moves to Sports department where the head will verify that the medical department declared you fit, and the he signs.
- Then it moves to bursary department where all fees and receipts are being verified, stamped and signed.
- Then it moves to Exams and Records department where the Receipts stamped by bursary department are verified and also all your exam records are validated and signed.
- Then it moves to the senate/Panel, where the result will be approved and the form signed amd stamped.
- Then you're issued statement of Result.
