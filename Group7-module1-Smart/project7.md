# UI/UX FUNDAMENTALS

UX design is rapidly revolutionizing the world around us and how we interact with products, businesses, services, and each other. It’s essential to creating usable and desirable products that help companies, consumers, and even whole societies find solutions to difficult or troubling problems.

But what exactly is user experience? And why does it matter so much?

First, let’s break down what we mean when we say, “user”—or better yet, who we mean. Simply put, a user is a person who purchases or interacts with a product, digital interface, or service. Therefore, a user experience (UX) is the series of events that occur when that person actually uses the product, digital interface, or service.

And UX design is the process of discovering user needs and designing solutions to meet them.

If UX design is the art of carefully curating the experience a user will have when interacting with a certain product or service, UX designers are the artists who do the work of creating that experience. That’s not to say that you need to be artistic in the traditional sense of the word! In fact UX designers cultivate a broad range of skills (including non-design skills) that have little or nothing to do with being “artsy.”

UX designers take into account many things when crafting a good user experience, not just aesthetics or impressive visuals. They must consider the usability and accessibility of the product, as well as a variety of design principles, usability heuristics, and information architecture. And let’s not forget the importance of understanding users’ expectations (discovered through user research) and factoring in business goals (with a solid UX strategy).

## The five main principles of UX design

There are many important principles within UX design but to simplify things a bit, we’ve broken them down into five main concepts: Empathy, strategy, usability, inclusivity, and validation.

* Empathy
Quality UX design puts users’ needs at the forefront of product development. To understand the user and what obstacles they face, UX designers must practice empathic design. With empathy, designers are able to put themselves in the user’s shoes and learn about their daily life, what problems they need solved, what expectations they have when interacting with certain products, and what a good experience looks like to them.

* Strategy
Designing effective solutions to difficult problems can be a complex process. Therefore, a crucial part of UX design is having a well-defined plan and set of goals before starting any project. Many designers will craft a UX strategy that outlines a variety of UX objectives including chosen research methods, preferred design and testing systems, and what success looks like for both the user and the business. While an important guideline to follow, a UX strategy is not unchangeable and may be amended as designers move through the design process.

* Usability
In a world of rapidly advancing and sometimes confusing technology, consumers often lean towards products that take little brain power to operate. The last thing a user wants is to feel like ordering food delivery on their phone is equivalent to completing a 1000 piece puzzle. A big part of UX design is making products and services that are simple and intuitive to use for people of all ages and abilities. To do this, designers take into account things like behavioral psychology, accessibility, affordances, and mental models when designing for optimal and effortless usability.

* Inclusivity
A common phrase you may hear in the UX industry is “design for all”—meaning that our design efforts should take into account the needs of people of all races, ages, genders, backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and more. UX designers have the ability to shape the world around them through their designs and the power to solve complex problems that affect a wide range of individuals.
* Validation
However impressive a design may seem, it would mean nothing if not validated by user testing. One of the most crucial aspects of UX design is to test proposed solutions with the people who will actually be using them in real life. User feedback guides and informs the design process and helps ensure that the products being made are ones people will happily want to use. Even after products are released, designers are constantly using methods to assess their success and where improvements can be made.

## What do UX designers do?

On a day-to-day basis, UX designers complete tasks like user research, usability testing, sketching wireframes and prototypes, running focus groups, or presenting their work to stakeholders.

## Benefits of UX design (and UX designers!)

UX designers are an invaluable addition to a wide range of industries in product development and beyond. So why does UX matter and what do UX designers really accomplish? We’ve narrowed it down to these five major points.

* Attention to UX design boosts customer acquisition and retention
A valuable and enjoyable user experience does a lot for attracting and keeping loyal customers. UX design can help a company’s products, mobile apps, and websites operating with minimal friction and ensure they appear modern, trustworthy, and on par with current trends—all things that help bring customers in and keep them engaged.

* Good UX maximizes revenue
When a user is satisfied with their experience with a brand, not only will they continue to use it or purchase more, they may also share their positive experience with their peers. Organic engagement and word-of-mouth advertisement can do wonders for a company’s profit margin. UX designers are trained to figure out what user’s want and how to design for higher conversion rates making the potential for increased sales quite high.

* Great UX designers help keeps development costs in check
UX designers are trained to find optimal solutions for both the user and the business. Their approach to problem solving and design is carefully planned and backed by evidence from user research. Therefore, with a UX designer on board, many companies can keep development costs low and minimize wasted resources as there is less need for re-design and troubleshooting.

* UX designers can help increase company productivity
Sometimes the user a designer is creating for isn’t a customer but rather company employees. Businesses may hire UX designers to help streamline business processes, optimize company policy, or re-design employee software that’s easier and more efficient to use. Smoother workflow often leads to increased employee productivity, motivation, and overall better company function.

* Ultimately: UX improves users’ quality of life
UX design has the potential to solve complex problems that plague underserved populations, troubled societies, or people in high stress careers. UX designers have been called upon for improving individuals access to healthcare, education, housing, food, and more. The ability to make a positive, meaningful, and long-lasting impact on people’s lives is a big part of what makes UX design such an attractive career choice.
