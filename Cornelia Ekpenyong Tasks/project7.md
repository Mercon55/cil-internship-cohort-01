## Twitter UI change
August 2021, the Bird app company rolled out a number of changes across its web interface and mobile apps. These included the introduction of its proprietary font, Chirp, as well as making some buttons and features more high contrast.

However, many of these changes attracted criticism. Most users like myself noted that the ‘follow’ button’s colour scheme had been completely reversed, causing confusion and frequent accidental unfollowing. Previously, a colour-filled button indicated to a user that they already followed a given account, but a colour-filled button now signals that a user is not following someone.  
In the Twitter Accessibility account, the company tweeted that it was “making contrast changes” because users “told us the new look is uncomfortable for people with sensory sensitivities”.

Accessibility researcher Alex Haagaard noted that this is indicative of the contrasting needs of different groups of people from a user interface, or UI, perspective. Colour blind or vision impaired people can benefit from high-contrast design, but it acts as a barrier for people with photosensitivity, for example.

## How my Past Job Share Similarities with UX Design Processes
In my past Job I was a primary School teacher, I worked with children below the ages of 10 years old, active and very curious pupils. Children as we know tend to have very short attention span and as a teacher tasked with teaching them mathematics I had to find a way of making the classes visiually and mentally stimulating to them. I had to find a way to keep them interested enough to actually learn their topics for the day. I made notice that they love playing around with colorful toys during recess and they were having issues with division, so i incorporated rather "colorful" intructional materials by performing simple divion using colorful balls I found at the play ground ball pit. That way they were able to visually see the division take place in front of their eyes rather than in abstract.

## What is UX Design
User experience (UX) is the relationship between a product and the person using it. UX design focuses on building products that someone can easily use and enjoy using. User experience design is about supporting user's needs, but making sure not to distract them from the overall experience of the product
## What does a UX designer actually do?
A UX Designer is focused on all aspects of a product's development, including design, usability, funcion, and even branding and marketing. Their work touches the entire end-to-end journey of a user's interaction with a product, and includes identifying new opportunities for the product and business.
## How is UX design different to other design fields?
User interface tends to do more with the actual features of the device, such as the screen, buttons, scrolling features and sound; User experience is the more general term that deals with everything a user experiences from start to finish. People often confuse UI vs. UX because the two are closely connected. User interface is a key part of a user’s overall experience since it’s the part of a device that a user most interacts with, but it doesn’t cover the entirety of a user’s experience across a website or platform. One common metaphor for UI vs. UX is to compare them to restaurants. If UI is the plate, silverware and napkins, UX is the lighting, music and customer service that facilitates your dining experience.
