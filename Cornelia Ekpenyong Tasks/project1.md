# TCP/IP Layered process. #
The OCI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptualized model that is used to describe the workings of the networking system it is made up seven (7) layers namely:
1. Physical Layer
2. Data Link Layer
3. Network Layer
4. Transport Layer
5. Session Layer
6. Presentation Layer
8. Application Layer 
Each intermediate layer serves a class of functionality to the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. It was designed to describe the functions of the communication system by dividing the communication procedure into smaller and simpler components. We shall be looking at a similar and more current layered process used for Networking called the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Intenet Protocol) layered process. <br/>
TCP/IP Model helps you to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the internet and how data should be transmitted between them. It helps you to create a virtual network when multiple computer networks are connected together. The purpose of TCP/IP model is to allow communication over large distances. TCP/IP Stack is specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork.The functionality of the TCP IP model is divided into four layers:
1. ## Network Access Layer ##
   The network access layer, also known as the data link layer, handles the physical infrastructure that lets computers communicate with one another over the internet. This covers ethernet cables, wireless networks, network interface cards, device drivers in your computer, and so on.
   The network access layer also includes the technical infrastructure — such as the code that converts digital data into transmittable signals — that makes network connection possible.


2. ## Internet Layer ## 
    The internet layer, also known as the network layer, controls the flow and routing of traffic to ensure data is sent speedily and accurately. This layer is also responsible for reassembling the data packet at its destination. If there’s lots of internet traffic, the internet layer may take a little longer to send a file, but there will be a smaller chance of an error corrupting that file.
3. ## Transport Layer ##
    The transport layer provides a reliable data connection between two communicating devices. It’s like sending an insured package: The transport layer divides the data in packets, acknowledges the packets it has received from the sender, and ensures that the recipient acknowledges the packets it receives.
4. ## Application Layer ##
    The application layer is the group of applications that let the user access the network. For most of us that means email, messaging apps, and cloud storage programs. This is what the end-user sees and interacts with when sending and receiving data. 

Whether you have an IPv4 or IPv6 address, you’re likely already using the TCP/IP model. This is the standard model for most existing internet infrastructure. There are different categories of IP addresses that may affect your privacy or how the protocol works — such as public vs. local IP addresses or static vs. dynamic IPs — but they still follow the standard TCP/IP model.
