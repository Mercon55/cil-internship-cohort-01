## Scrum

Scrum is a light-weight process tool use in an agile software development lifecycle. This process is use to split an organisation into smaller, cross-functional teams, which allow for work/time to be split into concrete, small deliverable features and working on them by the order of priority. It makes use of daily standup and sprints to track teams progress.
Some of the benefits of the Scrum product strategy includes.
- It allows developer to be part of the decision making, which tends to increase the morale of the developers as their feelings can be aired.
- A major benefit is that the time to market is shorten by nearly 35%, as a result of the continuous iterative process which leads to quick feedbacks from the users, enabling the design team to make changes that suits the market needs.
- The return on investment is usually great with scrum as features/products with low interaction can easily to replaced with better ones, saving cost that would have been incur if the product was shipped after several months of intense development.
