# SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT
## TASK 1

### SCRUM.
This is a is an agile process or framework that enables teams to build products incrementally in iterations, to keep abreast of the changing market needs and to focus on delivering the highest business value in the shortest time.
The Scrum Methodology is defined by the following:
1. Scrum Roles:

    We have 3 scrum roles;

* Product Owner:  decides what needs to be built. This person has complete knowledge about the market and business needs, has a vision, and owns the return on investment (ROI) or the value delivered by the product.
 * Scrum Master:  he/she  is  a leader who serves the scrum team and ensure that scrum is understood and practiced by every team member in the true spirit. He should understand the skillsets of the team and motivated them to achieve their goals.
 * The development team: this is a self-organizing team that collaborates, shares their special skills and knowledge and is committed completely to fulfill the objective. They must have the necessary skills to execute the backlog items.

2.	Scrum Events
   These are time-boxed and allow teams to inspect their current work and   
   implement those learning in future time-boxes.

         Typical Scrum Events are: 
         - Sprint planning
         - Daily scrum
         - Sprint review
         - Sprint retrospective

3.	Scrum Artifacts
    Documentation in scrum is only through three main artifacts namely: 


        - Product backlog: is a dynamic list of functionalities the product might include, such that it provides value to users. The Product owner is responsible for for creating, managing, and prioritizing the backlog by focusing on 'WHAT' brings the highest value to the users. 
        
        - Sprint backlog: is a subset of the entire product backlog that the scrum team plans to implement in one iteration or sprint. Here, the team selects items from the product backlog that they commit to complete in one sprint 
        
        - Increment: is the work delivered at the end of every sprint. Typically, after every iteration there will be a Product Increment (PI) that delivers value and the final product will be a working software

4.	Scrum Values
    These are values which the team have to adhere to. 



        Here are the values:
        - Commitment, 
        - Courage,
        - Focus, 
        - Openness, and
        - Respect. 

## Benefits of scrum
* Quick deliverables – it ensures products are delivered sooner in a productive manner. Unlike the waterfall that takes time on each stage, scrum breaks the project into smaller stages and performs a sprint to ensure quick delivery.

* Easy to groom - Using the Scrum framework makes it flexible for everyone to refine in case any mistakes are identified mid-way and to fix those mistakes.

* Thrift usage – it reduces the time and money wasted in process like waterfall hence ensuring it is used effectively, whenever needed, thereby producing budget-friendly projects in a short period.

* Easy to cope - Scrum being a sub-group of agile can encompass changes in its project that are required by the client at ease with the help of its short sprint cycles and regular feedback.
* Lightweight process - This includes that the Scrum framework receives periodic updates of the progress done throughout the sprint through the events.

* Manageable units - However large a project may be, it could always be broken down into feasible items that can be realized in achievable sprints.

* Versatile - Grants access to any stage of development and allows maximum changeable actions within the scope of scrum methodology.

* Direct and clear - Each team member is aware in great clarity of each other's advancement made during the daily stand-up meetings.


# TASK 2
* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan
