# Describe any layered process you are familiar with to the OSI model.

TCP/IP:Stands for Transmission Transmission control protocol; It is used to interconnect computer network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used by private computer network (intranet or extranet).

      It is suite for communication protocols, therefore similar to the OSI model layers in the following ways:

- In the both model protocols are defined in a layerwise manner.

- In the both models data is divided into packets and each data may take individual routes from the source to the destination.

- Both models are based upon layered architecture.

      Furthermore, TCP/IP model has four layers while OSI model has seven layers, TCP/IP is a protocol oriented standard unlike the OSI model that is a model based on functionalities of each layer.

# TCP/IP LAYERS 
- APPLICATION LAYER 

- TRANSPORT LAYER 

- INTERNET LAYER 

- NETWORK ACCESS LAYER 

      The TCP defines how the application can create channels of communications across a network.
      The IP defines how to address the and route each packet to make sure it reaches the right destination.
