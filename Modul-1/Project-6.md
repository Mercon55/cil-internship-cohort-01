SCRUM: Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Often thought of an agile project management framework, scrum describes a set of meeting tools, and roles that works in concert to help teams structure and manage their work. Scrum is working towards a solutions and incremental radiations.

## FEATURES OF SCRUM: 

- Self organising , autonomous team. 

- Cross functional team.

- Incremental and iterative process.

- Learning and self transcendant. 

- Strategic direction rathar than a blueprint.

## Scrum gives you the platform to do the following:

- Produce product backlog and planning.

- Daily standups 

- Set sprint as a time box on work.

- Sprint goals.

- Story points for estimation.

## HERE ARE SOME BENEFITS OF SCRUM ON SOFTWARE MANAGEMENT:

- LESS RISKS: Using agile methodology a project can almost never fail, because it works in small sprints that results are continously delivered. When a mistake or there is need for correction on a project, there is always a chance to salvage it.

- CONTINOUSE CHANGE OR IMPROVEMENTS: Since agile methodology plans in sprints, there is always a chance that the present sprint is better than the last sprints. Collaboration with teams gives more room for new and better ideas.

- LOWER COSTS: When planning a project, it is always difficult to estimate the exact cost and most times scrum helps reduces the costs or does not allow a project to go over budget. Story pointing can be applied to estimate the complexity of any task.


(2) - Individuals and interactions over process and tools.

    - Working software over comprehensive documentation.

    - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.

    - Responding to change over following a plan.
