# UI/UX FUNDAMENTALS

User experience (UX) design is often mixed up with user interface (UI) design. Although the two work closely together, they are different. This article will give you a run-down on everything you need to know about UX design, from a UX designer’s business functions to useful tools and resources to become a better UX designer.

## What is user experience design?

User experience (UX) is the relationship between a product and the person using it. UX design focuses on building products that someone can easily use and enjoy using.

“User experience design is about supporting user’s needs, but making sure not to distract them from the overall experience of the product.

## What does a UX designer do?

A user experience (UX) designer makes sure a product is learnable and usable for the end-user. A UX designer works from the very beginning of any product process to ensure product teams are building products that are conscious of their users, their needs, and pain points.

A UX designer works with branding, navigation, content, and product functions to ensure all of these elements are tied together to create an end result that’s joyful and fluid.

UX designers are responsible for more than just the product experience and product lifecycle—they’re key players in the entire customer lifecycle.

## What’s the difference between a UX and a UI designer?

UI design is a little different because it focuses on human-computer interaction. This can be anything from a desktop web page to the usability of an app screen on a handheld device.

User interface designers (also known as interaction designers) focus solely on the interface of a product, not the flow between interfaces or the user’s experience going through the journey.

User interface design works closely with user experience design. Together, UX and UI designers conduct user research, measure usability, and are constantly testing designs for any stand-out success to replicate or error to fix.

A UI designer usually has some kind of understanding of front-end development and graphic design. They focus on visual assets, while a UX designer will focus on all parts of the user experience.

## What skills do UX designers need?

Let’s break this section into two parts; hard skills and soft skills needed in UX design.

There are certain practical skill sets a designer needs to learn to become a UX designer. At the same time, a UX designer needs to practice certain soft skills to become a successful UX designer.

### Hard skills UX designers need

### Soft skills UX designers need

1. Empathy: UX design leads with users in mind. You’ll need to investigate and completely understand the motivations, anxieties, needs, and problems of the people who will use your design. If you want the result to be functional and meaningful, it needs to be built with empathy. Forget about yourself. Listen to and understand what your users want.

2. Organization: UX design is like a puzzle. You can’t miss a single piece of research if you want it to be complete. Put all of those (user research) pieces together in a way that makes the most sense for the goal of the product, and you’ll have a successful design. Good organization is essential to get you there.

3. Curiosity: UX designers need to stay curious. If you want to discover that last piece to your UX design puzzle that ties everything together in harmony, a certain amount of curiosity is needed. This means you need to be comfortable in challenging assumptions and looking for alternative solutions to those that seem the most logical.

## Do user experience designers need to code?

In short, no. User experience designers don’t need to code, although it’s definitely a nice skill to have.

Even if a UX designer doesn’t code themselves, they’ll be working with engineers and developers that code for them, so it’s useful to understand coding capabilities.

By speaking the language, designers can better translate the feasibility of a user experience design concept.

## Some tools for UX designers

No matter how long you’ve been in the business, there will always be tools to help you get your work done more efficiently and accurately.However, a few well-known favorites are:

1. Figma: a collaborative, web-based, vector graphic edit and interface design tool
2. Adobe XD: a vector-based experience design platform
3. Maze: a rapid user-testing platform for user experience prototypes—gathering user feedback from real humans
4. Sketch: a collaborative digital design app for Mac
5. InVision: a digital product design platform
6. Webflow: a no-code, visual canvas website builder.
