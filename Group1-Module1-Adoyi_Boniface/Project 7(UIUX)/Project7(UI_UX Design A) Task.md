# UI/UX DESIGN TASKS

## Task 1

a. Website: https://www.jumia.com.ng
i like the Website layout and how the web contents are arranged.
I dislike the way the link are arranged, mostimes someone will have to strain his eyes to see that it is a link, it looks like an ordinary bullet item.

Also the Navigation left sidebar list dropdown menu is not properly organized, it should be like a button you will have to click to see the dropdown menu and not just a hover propmting it.

b. https://maxair.com.ng/book-flight
i like the layout and organization of the website, i also like the layout colour combinations.

i dislike the way the Home and Booking Flight links on the header Nav Bar were written, it is not bright enough to see, they used a very light font weight on it, making it bold o thicker would have been better.

# Task 2

Yes.
I once worked as a Network Operation Coordination Engineer with a Telecom Company and I majorly resolve Network outages of the Company's clients.
Each time there is an outage, I first of all perform investigations to know what brought about the outage, this phase is similar to the Research phase of UI/UX, after finding the cause of the outage, I proceed to the troubleshooting/ resolution phase which is similar to the design phase, after troubleshooting I test to check whether or not the resolution was successful, also, I ask the clients to test and see whether or not they are still experiencing the outage and after that I finalize and close on the case.

# Task 4

## What is User Experience (UX) Design?

User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function.

## Who is a UX Designer and what they actually do?

The answer to this question is, it depends. The UX designers job description can vary from company to company and sometimes even from project to project within the same company.

Generally, a UX designers conduct user research, design, write UX copy, validate/test with user and sell/present the design solution to the business. It’s the UX designer’s role to be the voice of the user and advocate for the users needs while balancing the business goals.

## UX Design vs Other Designs

### UX Design vs Graphics

Graphic design and UX design are both creative fields, but they work differently. Graphic designers tend to be perceived as more artistic, while UX designers have their finger on the pulse of what people want most. This is why there was a 289% increase in demand for them over graphic designers with only 3%.

A reason for this gap might be that graphic designers create an aesthetic to attract people, while UX designers focus on the user experience of a product or service by making it easy to use. This requires more technical knowledge than graphic design, because you have to learn how people interact with software and other products to make your design.
