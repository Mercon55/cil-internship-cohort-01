## Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's benefits in software development

### Scrum in Software Development.
Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining products in a complex environment, with an initial emphasis on software development, although it has been used in other fields including research, sales, marketing and advanced technologies.

It is designed for teams of ten or fewer members, who break their work into goals that can be completed within time-boxed iterations, called sprints, no longer than one month and most commonly two weeks.

 The Scrum Team assess progress in time-boxed daily meetings of 15 minutes or less, called daily scrums (a form of stand-up meeting). At the end of the sprint, the team holds two further meetings: the sprint review which demonstrates the work done to stakeholders to elicit feedback, and sprint retrospective which enables the team to reflect and improve.

### The Scrum team
The fundamental unit of scrum is a small team of people, consisting of a 

* **Product owner**
  
  The product owner, representing the product's stakeholders and the voice of the customer is responsible for delivering good business results.

* **Scrum master**
  
  Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables. The scrum master is not a traditional team lead or project manager but acts as a barrier between the team and any distracting influences.

* **Developers**
  
  The developers refers to anyone who plays a role in the development and support of the system or product.



### Benefits of Scrum in software development

**Better quality**

Projects exist to accomplish a vision or goal. Scrum provides the framework for continual feedback and exposure to make sure that quality is as high as possible.

**Decreased time to market**

Scrum has been proven to deliver value to the end customer 30 to 40 percent faster than traditional methods because it decreases time to market the product.

**Increased return on investment**

The decrease in time to market is one key reason that scrum projects realize a higher return on investment (ROI). Because revenue and other targeted benefits start coming in sooner, earlier accumulation means higher total return over time. This is a basic tenet of net present value (NPV) calculations.

**Higher customer satisfaction**

Scrum teams are committed to producing products and services that satisfy customers. 

**Higher team morale**

Working with happy people who enjoy their jobs can be satisfying and rewarding. Self-management puts decisions that would normally be made by a manager or the organization into scrum team members’ hands. 

**Increased collaboration and ownership**

When scrum teams take responsibility for projects and products, they can produce great results because Scrum teams collaborate and take ownership of quality and project performance.

**More relevant metrics**

The metrics that scrum teams use to estimate time and cost, measure project performance, and make project decisions are often more relevant and more accurate than metrics on traditional projects.

**Improved progress visibility and exposure**

On scrum projects, every member of the project team (which includes the scrum team and stakeholders) has the opportunity to know how the project is going at any given time. Transparency and visibility make scrum an exposure model to help the project team accurately identify issues and more accurately predict how things will go as the project progresses.

**Increased project control**

Scrum teams have numerous opportunities to control project performance and make corrections as needed.

**Reduced risk**

Scrum helps mitigate the risk of absolute project failure — spending large amounts of time and money with no return on investment — by delivering tangible product early and forcing scrum teams to fail early.


### The Manifesto for Agile Software Development 

* Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

* Working software over comprehensive documentation

* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

* Responding to change over following a plan
