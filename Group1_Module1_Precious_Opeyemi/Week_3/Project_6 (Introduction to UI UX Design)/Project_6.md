# Task 8 (week 3)
## Write an article on UI/UX Fundamental


### What is UI/UX?

**UI design** is about using typography, images, and other visual design elements to turn a basic interface into something digestible and usable.

**UX design** is concerned with the overall user-friendliness of an entire customer journey.



### What is the difference between UX and UI design?

The difference between User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) is that 

UI refers to the aesthetic elements by which people interact with a product, while UX is about the experience a user has with a product or service.

So, UI focuses on visual interface elements such as typography, colors, menu bars, and more, while UX focuses on the user and their journey through the product.

### What are the UX design disciplines?

UX is a broad umbrella term that can be divided up into four main disciplines: 

1. Experience Strategy (ExS),

2. Interaction Design (IxD), 

3. User Research (UR)

4. Information Architecture (IA).


#### Experience Strategy (ExS)
UX design is not just about the end user; it also brings huge value to the business providing the product or service. Experience strategy is all about devising a holistic business strategy, incorporating both the customer’s needs and those of the company.

#### Interaction Design (IxD)
Interaction design looks at how the user interacts with a system, considering all interactive elements such as buttons, page transitions and animations. Interaction designers seek to create intuitive designs that allow the user to effortlessly complete core tasks and actions.

#### User Research (UR)
UX design is all about identifying a problem and designing the solution. This requires extensive research and feedback from existing or potential customers. During the research phase, UX designers will launch surveys, conduct interviews and usability testing, and create user personas in order to understand the end user’s needs and objectives. They gather both qualitative and quantitative data and use this to make good design decisions. 

#### Information Architecture (IA)
Information architecture is the practice of organizing information and content in a meaningful and accessible way. This is crucial in helping the user to navigate their way around a product. To determine the IA of any given product, information architects consider the relationship between different sets of content. They also pay close attention to the language used and ensure that it is both convincing and consistent.


### Who is a UX Designer?
 A UX designer is someone whose job is to ensure users derive satisfaction from a product and also make the the product actually fulfills the users needs.

 They design with main focus of ensuring products are continually improved, usable and accessible.



### What are the UX designer's job descriptions?

Tasks and responsibilities

* Plan and conduct user research and competitor analysis
* Interpret data and qualitative feedback
* Create user stories, personas, and storyboards
* Determine information architecture and create sitemaps
* Create prototypes and wireframes
* Conduct usability testing


Skills and requirements

* Adaptability
* Communication, collaboration and teamwork
* Problem-solving
* Design thinking
* A user-centric mindset
* Attention to detail
* Creative and analytical approach
* Understanding of interaction design principles
* Knowledge of industry tools such as Sketch, InVision, Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, Zeplin and OmniGraffle
* Business know-how: Understanding of business metrics and the ability to translate company goals and objectives into digital experiences




### What makes a Great UI?

1. Make buttons and other common elements perform predictably (including responses such as pinch-to-zoom) so users can unconsciously use them everywhere. Form should follow function.

2. Maintain high discoverability. Clearly label icons and include well-indicated affordances: e.g., shadows for buttons.

3. Keep interfaces simple (with only elements that help serve users’ purposes) and create an “invisible” feel.

4. Respect the user’s eye and attention regarding layout. Focus on hierarchy and readability:
    1. Use proper alignment. Typically choose edge (over center) alignment.
    2. Draw attention to key features using:
        * Color, brightness and contrast. Avoid including colors or buttons excessively.
        * Text via font sizes, bold type/weighting, italics, capitals and distance between letters. Users should pick up meanings just by scanning.

5. Minimize the number of actions for performing tasks but focus on one chief function per page. Guide users by indicating preferred actions. Ease complex tasks by using progressive disclosure.

6. Put controls near objects that users want to control. For example, a button to submit a form should be near the form.

7. Keep users informed regarding system responses/actions with feedback.

8. Use appropriate UI design patterns to help guide users and reduce burdens (e.g., pre-fill forms). Beware of using dark patterns, which include hard-to-see prefilled opt-in/opt-out checkboxes and sneaking items into users’ carts.

9. Maintain brand consistency.

10. Always provide next steps which users can deduce naturally, whatever their context.
