FRUSTRATING:

1. Whatsapp This Message Was Deleted Feature: When a message is sent either with error or to a wrong person and the sender deletes. The main purpose is to delete it and pretend it was never sent. But whatsapp informs the reciever the message was deleted which defeats the purpose in a way.
