# Description of Scrum

Scrum is a light weight Agile process tool. It is a framework that allows for more effective collaborations among teams working on complex projects. It advocates self-organizing teams working towards a common goal through continuous inspection and adaptation. A minimum viable product at the end of each iteration provides an option for the teams to quickly get feedback from end users and respond much faster. In particular, scrum is a collection of meetings, roles and tools that work together to help teams to better structure and manage their workload.
