User experience (UX) design is often mixed up with user interface (UI) design. Although the two work closely together, they are different. User experience (UX) is the relationship between a product and the person using it. UX design focuses on building products that someone can easily use and enjoy using.
User experience design is about supporting user’s needs, but making sure not to distract them from the overall experience of the product.

## What does a UX designer do?

A user experience (UX) designer makes sure a product is learnable and usable for the end-user. A UX designer works from the very beginning of any product process to ensure product teams are building products that are conscious of their users, their needs, and pain points.

A UX designer works with branding, navigation, content, and product functions to ensure all of these elements are tied together to create an end result that’s joyful and fluid.

UX designers are responsible for more than just the product experience and product lifecycle—they’re key players in the entire customer lifecycle.

The decisions a UX designer makes influences if a user is attracted to, willing to pay for, and can use a product in the first place. Updates and tweaks a UX designer makes to a live product can positively affect customer retention rates and customer lifetime value (CLTV).

## What’s the difference between a UX and a UI designer?

UI design is a little different because it focuses on human-computer interaction. This can be anything from a desktop web page to the usability of an app screen on a handheld device.

User interface designers (also known as interaction designers) focus solely on the interface of a product, not the flow between interfaces or the user’s experience going through the journey.

User interface design works closely with user experience design. Together, UX and UI designers conduct user research, measure usability, and are constantly testing designs for any stand-out success to replicate or error to fix.

A UI designer usually has some kind of understanding of front-end development and graphic design. They focus on visual assets, while a UX designer will focus on all parts of the user experience.

## What skills do UX designers need?

Let’s break this section into two parts; hard skills and soft skills needed in UX design.

There are certain practical skill sets a designer needs to learn to become a UX designer. At the same time, a UX designer needs to practice certain soft skills to become a successful UX designer.
