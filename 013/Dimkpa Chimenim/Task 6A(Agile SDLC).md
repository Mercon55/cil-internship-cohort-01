#SCRUM
Scrum framework allows implementing Agile development methodology. Unlike the waterfall model of software development, Scrum enables an iterative and incremental development process. The project divides into several phases, each of which results in a ready-to-use product. At the end of each step (called sprint in Scrum terminology), a usable product is delivered to a customer. Customer feedback helps reveal possible problems or change the initial development plan if needed.

Benefits To Software Development
Scrum can help teams complete project deliverables quickly and efficiently: By splitting project into smaller unit, the task are completed faster and it helps reduce complexity.
Works well for fast-moving development projects: Feedback and communication is of top priority, this helps for requirement gathering thus reducing the time it takes to make.
Scrum ensures effective use of time and money: Holding scrum meetings enable project manager estimate proper project time frames, staff performance and blockers/challenges. Which help cut down cost on the long run.
