I've come to understand that UI And UX designs are not the same.
Both aim to perform a given objective which is creating amazing interfaces. They have different roles though they may intersect.

The User Experience(UX) designer is responsible for carrying out the following tasks
-User Research: This tasks involves carrying out interviews with intended users(knowing their wants and needs),investigating current products/systems and creating user personas.
The user personas put the UX designer in the shoes of the user.
-Sketching Wireframes: The UX designer creates wireframes which are digital freehand drawing of designs. These wireframes give descriptions as to the various functionalities of the different components of the intended system/product.
-Creating Prototypes: The U designer with the help of software tools develops a dummy for the users to test the intended product. Feedback is got and enhancement made.

The User Interface(UI) designer is responsible
-Builds mockups
-Create layouts
-Visual design
-Compose graphics

So in essence the UX designer handles first stage of interface designs. The design phase then proceeds to the UI designer who physically implements the sketch and wireframes.
# MISCONCEPTIONS
A popular misconception is that UX designers need to be adept in making sketches, have amazing taste for aesthetics, but this is false.
UX designer is not just making sketches or mockups, rather conducting researches, logical reasoning, data storage and navigation to mention a few.
A product may have good aesthetic design but lack proper navigation or ambiguous icons. Which in turn will lead to users having a torrid time.
Thus the UX design is very important to ensure the intended product performs to user expectation.
