#TCP/IP
TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).
TCP and IP are the two main protocols, though others are included in the suite. The TCP/IP protocol suite functions as an abstraction layer between internet applications and the routing and switching fabric.
TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. TCP/IP requires little central management and is designed to make networks reliable with the ability to recover automatically from the failure of any device on the network.

#Similarities Between TCP/IP & OSI
-Both are logical models.
-Both define standards for networking.
-Both provide a framework for creating and implementing networking standards and devices.
-Both divide the network communication process into layers.
-In both models, a single layer defines a particular functionality and sets standards for that functionality only.
-Both models allow a manufacturer to make devices and network components that can coexist and work with the devices and components made by other manufacturers.
-Both models simplify the troubleshooting process by dividing complex functions into simpler components.
-Instead of defining the already defined standards and protocols, both models referenced them. For example, the Ethernet standards were already defined by IEEE before the creation of these models. So instead of defining them again both models used them as IEEE Ethernet standards.
