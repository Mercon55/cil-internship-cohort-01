## The TCP/IP model

The TCP/IP term stands for Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol. The stack is specifically designed as a model to offer highly reliable and end-to-end byte stream over an unreliable internetwork. Also, it helps to determine how a specific computer should be connected to the internet and how data should be transmitted between them, it helps to create a virtual network when multiple computer networks are connected together. The purpose of this model is to allow long distance communication.


# TCP Characteristics

* Support  for a flexible TCP/IP architecture
* Adding More system to a network is easy.
* TCP is a connection-oriented protocol
* TCP offers reliability and ensures that data which arrives out of sequence should be put back into order.

The TCP/IP Model is a layered structure similar to the OSI model and it has four layers. 

# Four Layers of TCP/IP Model.

* Application layer.
* Transport layer.
* Internet layer.
* Network Interface layer.

## Differences between the OSI and TCP/IP models.
 
* OSI follows vertical approach while TCP/IP models follows horizontal approach.
* OSI layers have seven layers while TCP/IP layers have four layers.
* OSI model, the transport layer is only connection-oriented while a layer of the TCP/IP model is both connection-oriented and connectionless.
