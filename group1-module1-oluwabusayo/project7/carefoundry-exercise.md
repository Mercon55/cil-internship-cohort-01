**Likes:**
* The color used are cool, not too flashy.

* Icons were properly added to texts, nav, search box etc to beautify the page in the right propotion.
* I can grapse everything on the page at glance which makes my work easier and make navigation a lot simpler.
* Search box appears on the right side of the page which makes search for a feature alot more easier.
* Hightlights were properly attached on every technical features when mouse hovers on them to give more info about the functions.


**Not good enough**
* Editing the values and content of View Features is to complex to understand
