## PROJECT SOLUTION

### TCP/IP

This is a system designed to transmit data from one system to another. This data are sent in packets which are optimized in a way that the entire data are not sent at ones in case of disconnection and are being assembled by the receiving system.

**TCP/IP is broken down into two parts:**

1. TCP- Transmission Control Protocol
2. IP- Internet Protocol
1. Transmission Control Protocol or TCP is a communication system designed to allow the exchanges of data or information by programs and devices via a network. It is responsible for ensuring that that packets of data sent over the internet is sent to the correct machine.
2. Internet Protocol or IP is a unique digital address that is assigned to every connected device. It is a medium for sending data across the World Wide Web.
 IP address is an important layer in the TCP/IP system as it’s used to deliver data to and from the right device.

**The Four layers of TCP/IP Model:**

1.	Application Layer
2.	Transport Layer
3.	Network Access Layer
4.	Internet Layer

**Functions of TCP/IP Layers**

1.	**Application Layer** is the topmost layer in the TCP/IP model. It allows user to communicate with the application and it is responsible for the handling of high-level protocols, issues of representation. Some of the main protocols being used in application layer are HTTP, SMTP FTP etc.
2.	**Transport Layer** is responsible for the reliability, flow control and correction of data which is being sent over the network.
The two protocols used in the transport payer are User Datagram Protocol or UDP and transmission Control Protocol or TCP.
TCP returns feed while UDP does not return feedback.
3.	**Network Layer** is the lowest layer in the TCP/IP. It is the combination of both Physical payer and Data Link layer in OSI model. It main responsibility is transmission of data between two devices on the same network.
The protocols used by this layer are Ethernet, token ring, FDDI etc.
4.	The Internet layer is equivalent to the Network layer in OSI Model. Logical addressing and routing is performed and this layer by using the IP address of a device.
At this layer, the router forward packets on the basis of IP addresses of devices.
The protocols used at this layer are Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP).
