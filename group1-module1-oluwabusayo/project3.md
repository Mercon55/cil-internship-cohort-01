## PROJECT SOLUTION

Virtual Studio Code, VSC IDE was set up on my laptop and the steps I took to achieve this are listed below:
1.	I downloaded the 64 bit VS Code .exe file (Window Version) from [Visual Studio Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
2.	I double clicked  the downloaded file in my Downloads Folder to install the App
3.	I clicked on the dialog box to accept the **agreement**.
4.	I followed the default path for the appâ€™s files to be saved/installed and continued with the options on the screen.
5.	Then I clicked **install** button to continue the installation and clicked on **finish** to complete the installation

### Reasons why I chose to install VS Code on my laptop:
1.	Ability of VS code to use extensions.
2.	Built in short cuts; Emmet Abbreviations.
3.	The integration of CLI.
4.	ESLint which helps spot error in the code fixes them as I write codes.
5.	Multi-cursor shortcuts which gives the ability to edit with multiple cursors.
6.	Text Wrap feature.
7.	It has the ability to execute and debug of JavaScript.
