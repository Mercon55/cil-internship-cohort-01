2. Customer has early and frequent opportunities to look at the product and make a decision
3. Error can be fixed in the middle of the project
4. Every iteration has its own testing phase. It allows implementing regression testing every time new function or logic is released.
5. It also ensure effective use of time and money since the team get clear visibility through the regular scrum meetings
