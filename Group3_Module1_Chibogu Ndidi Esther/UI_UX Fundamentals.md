# UI/UX Fundamentals

## What is UI design?
User interface (UI) design refers to the visual design of a product’s digital interface, such as an app screen or website. It’s the process of designing the visual and interactive properties of a visual experience, ensuring the interface is both clear for the user to navigate and overall aesthetically pleasing. UI design is a multidisciplinary field involving various elements from visual design, UX design, and graphic design.

### What do UI designers do?
UI designers are responsible for ensuring the product’s interface is visually stimulating, easy to navigate, and in line with business goals. They’re also responsible for establishing visual consistency across a digital product through creating style guides and UI pattern libraries. 

UI designers often work closely with user experience (UX) designers throughout the digital design process. While UX focuses on the optimization of a product for practical use, UI design is all about a product’s look and feel. UI designers will take the foundations laid by the UX designer—the wireframes, user mapping, and information architecture—and bring everything to life with a gorgeous color palette, typography, and shapes. 

In order to design user-friendly and intuitive interfaces, UI designers keep accessibility and inclusivity in their mind at all times. They’re constantly weighing up each design choice and what it means for the end-user. UI design is all about detail, and UI designers have the complex task of considering all the visual aspects of the user’s journey, including all the individual screens and touchpoints that the user might encounter, from tapping a button to scrolling down a page.

### What are the most important skills and traits for a UI designer to have?
Some of the most essential UI design skills and traits include:

- Proficiency in popular industry-standard tools such as Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma, and InVision
- Knowledge of color theory, UX and interaction design principles, and typography (to name a few)
- A keen eye for aesthetics and sharp attention to detail—to create harmonious, visually appealing designs, and to be able to spot when something looks “off”
- An interest in people and human behavior. UI design ties in closely with user experience, so the best UI designers work with empathy, keeping humans at the forefront
- A certain degree of tech know-how. In addition to working with computer-based tools, UI designers must understand how their designs will operate on different platforms, devices, and screen sizes. It’s therefore useful to be a little tech savvy (especially when liaising with developers)
- Collaboration and communication. UI designers rarely work in isolation—you’ll collaborate closely with UX designers, product managers, developers, and content / UX writers, so interpersonal skills are a must!

## What is UX design?
UX design, or user experience design, is the process of creating products and experiences that help users get done what they’ve come to do—as efficiently and effectively as possible.

But what is user experience? In short, the user experience is how users feel as they engage with your product. This concept applies to physical objects and daily experiences, like using a coffee maker or buying a car at a dealership; but it also applies to the digital side of life—think about the last time you transferred money using a banking app, purchased something online, or even played a game on your phone. 

UX design is the process of understanding and empathizing with the actual needs and goals of your users, diving into that user experience, locating the problems (often called “pain points”), and finding solutions that result in a better user experience. 

### What does a UX designer actually do?
Guided by the design thinking process (more on this in a moment), a UX designer understands and advocates for the needs and goals of the user.

This process begins with empathy. UX designers connect with users and seek to understand what makes them tick, as well as what they really need from this product or experience. That’s called user research and it comprises the bulk of the empathize stage of the process. 

The next stage is to clearly define what problems, needs, and goals users have that the product could potentially solve or help users achieve. This leads naturally into the ideation stage, when UX designers actively come up with feasible solutions to the problems they’ve defined. This ideation can take many forms, but it’s not unlike brainstorming ideas for classes, projects, and lesson plans. 

In the prototyping stage, UX designers take their solutions and build them into a functioning model so they can share the ideas with stakeholders and test the solutions to make sure they’ll actually work. And that’s the final stage of the process: testing to make sure that the solutions they’ve arrived at will actually improve the user experience.

### What is a UX designer’s core skillset?
Because of the sheer scope of the work UX designers do, it’s easy to see that the core skillset  is incredibly broad. It includes everything from conducting user research and cultivating empathy for their users (in themselves and among key stakeholders and others involved in the product development process), to leading design thinking workshops and developing, presenting, testing and iterating on prototypes and wireframes. 

A great UX designer can connect and communicate with a broad variety of audiences (internal and external to the organization and the design process). They are empathetic and curious—always ready to learn more. They’re critical thinkers who can approach problems in strategic ways while they embrace the creativity required to arrive at truly innovative and effective solutions. 

UX designers are also fluent in a variety of tools and processes involved in user research, usability testing, communication and project management, visual design, wireframing, and prototyping. Many UX writers  also specialize in UX research, UI design, and/or UX writing. Impressive!
