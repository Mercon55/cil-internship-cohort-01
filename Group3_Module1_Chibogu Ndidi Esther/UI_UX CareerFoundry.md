### Tutorial 1 - Task 1

Your mission for today is to start browsing websites and apps you use frequently and to make a note of anything that you find intuitive or frustrating.Focus on how easy or difficult the website or app is for you to use. Can you find what you’re looking for? Is it easy for you to accomplish your goals? 

Certain things I noticed on the websites I visit and the apps I use;
- I am attracted to appealing colours, so a website whose colours are out of place doesn't give me a good user experience
- I make use of online resources, for instance I want to resize a file or remove background from an image. I find it frustrating when I am directed to various pages and I don't get the desired result I want. For instance, I preferably use http://removebg.com/ for removing background images since the process is an easy one. It doesn't require me to sign up or create an account then confirming the account. All of those processes are tedious for me.
- I find it difficult navigating some online shopping websites where you will have to make payments online. Like there are no clear icons showing how to return to previous pages and maybe even give tips on how to proceed to payment.
- Some websites lose alignment on smaller screen size. On laptop, it may be looking cool but then on other devices the design is horrible.


### Tutorial 2 - Task 2

 Think about the UX design process—do any of the functions or tasks that we discussed resemble anything you do in your current job? If so, write down what they are and how they’re similar to the UX design process.

 In my current job as a frontend web developer, I often combine development with design stage. Particularly I worked with a group made up of product managers, product designer, data scientist, front end and backend developers in designing a telemedicine app. As part of the design process, we had to conduct a user research to get feedback from our prospective users. We did this severally, before the development process and after the development process. This helped in improving the quality of our work and better serving the users. 


 ### Tutorial 3 - Task 3
 Today we explored the different areas of UX design and the various routes that a career in UX might take you. Your mission today is to identify some key UX influencers and try to categorize them into one or two of the quadrants. Where do their strengths and interests appear to lie? Do they match a particular job title?

 - I'm not particularly familiar with any known UX influencers and so couldn't make a good  judgement on which quadrant they fall into


 ### Tutorial 4 - Task 4

Let’s imagine you’re a newly qualified UX designer and have just started your first job in the field. Someone asks you what you do, but when you say “UX design”, they look rather confused. How would you explain to them what UX design is and what your role entails? Think about the following:

- What is UX design?
User experience, UX encompasses all aspects of the end-user’s interaction with the company, its services, and its products

- What does a UX designer actually do?

A UX Designer is focused on all aspects of a product's development, including design, usability, funcion, and even branding and marketing.  Their work touches the entire end-to-end journey of a user's interaction with a product, and includes identifying new opportunities for the product and business

- How is UX design different to other design fields?
UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems; UI design is all about creating intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing, interactive interfaces.
    

### Tutorial 5 - Task 5
Browse the internet and find two or three portfolios that catch your eye. For each portfolio, identify three things that you think the designer does well, and why. At the same time, look out for some aspects that could be improved. Pay attention to the “About me” sections, the overall usability of each portfolio, and most importantly, how they present their case studies. Do they document their process thoroughly? How do they demonstrate their approach to problem solving? How could they present a stronger narrative?

- https://www.glorialo.design/. This is a portfolio of Gloria Lo, a product designer. She started with a good and catchy introduction that describes her in terms of her favourite activities. In the about session, she spoke about her values and passion and one could easy relate with her personality. Also, she included a testimonial session given by a reputable person. She also gave a detailed case studies of all the projects she worked on and added illustrations.

- https://www.moritzoesterlau.de/. This is a portfolio of Moritz Oesterlau, a UI/UX designer and a tutor at CareerFoundry. He included the detailed process in solving a user's problem for each of the projects he did. He also included the methods and processes he employed. His case studies were also well detailed and he documented the projects he undertook from start to finish. 

## Tutorial 6 -Task 6
For today’s task, you’re going to devise a quick UX career roadmap! Don’t worry, it’s not as complicated or time-consuming as it might sound.

Start by listing three main hard skills and three main soft skills that you’ve gained in your career so far. Remember: hard skills are job-specific, while soft skills include things like communication, collaboration, and empathy. Next, list three hard skills and three soft skills that you think you’ll need as a UX designer. Are there any parallels between your existing skillset and those you’ll need for UX?

For the second part of your roadmap, consider the logistics of how you might start mastering those key UX skills. How many hours a week could you dedicate to learning UX? Which route of study would be the most viable option in terms of time and cost? Jot everything down next to your skills list!

#### Three Hard skills I have gained in my career
- HTML/CSS
- Responsive/Mobile Design
- Javascript

#### Three Soft skills I have gained in my career
- Communication
- Team work
- Organization

#### Three Hard skills I will need as a UX designer
- User Research
- Wireframing
- Prototyping

#### Three SOft skills I will need as a UX designer
- Collaboration
- Communication
- Empathy

From these different list, in transitioning to becoming a UX designer I will need to develop the necessary hard and soft skills. To be able to master these skills, I will need to commit an average of 10-15 hours per week and use online resource in developing my skills. I will also be on the lookout to work on projects with others.
