## 1. Describe what you understand by Scrum, and elaborate on some of it's benefits in software development.

### What is Scrum?

Scrum is an agile development methodology used in the development of Software based on an iterative and incremental processes. Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value. Scrum is adaptable, fast, flexible and effective agile framework that is designed to deliver value to the customer throughout the development of the project. 

The primary objective of Scrum is to satisfy the customer’s need through an environment of transparency in communication, collective responsibility and continuous progress. The development starts from a general idea of ​​what needs to be built, elaborating a list of characteristics ordered by priority (product backlog) that the owner of the product wants to obtain.

### Benefits of Scrum in software development


- #### Better quality
    Projects exist to accomplish a vision or goal. Scrum provides the framework for continual feedback and exposure to make sure that quality is as high as possible. Scrum helps ensure quality by the following practices:

    - Defining and elaborating on requirements just in time so that knowledge of product features is as relevant as possible

    - Incorporating daily testing and product owner feedback into the development process, allowing the development team to address issues while they’re fresh

    - Regular and continuous improvement of scrum team output (product or service) through sprint reviews with stakeholders

    - Conducting sprint retrospectives, allowing the scrum team to continuously improve such team-specific factors as processes, tools, relationships, and work environments

    - Completing work using the definition of done that addresses development, testing, integration, and documentation

- #### Decreased time to market
    Scrum has been proven to deliver value to the end customer 30 to 40 percent faster than traditional methods. This decrease in time is due to the following factors:

    - Earlier initiation of development due to the fact the upfront documentation phases of waterfall projects (which typically take months) are foregone by having a dedicated product owner embedded within the scrum team to progressively elaborate requirements “just in time” and provide real-time clarification.

    - Highest-priority requirements are separated from lower-priority items. Incrementally delivering value to the end customer means that the ­highest-value and -risk requirements can be delivered before the lower-value and risk requirements. No need to wait until the entire project is complete before releasing anything into the market.

    - Functionality is swarmed to completion each sprint. At the end of every sprint, scrum teams produce working product and service increments that are shippable.

- #### Increased return on investment
    The decrease in time to market is one key reason that scrum projects realize a higher return on investment (ROI). Because revenue and other targeted benefits start coming in sooner, earlier accumulation means higher total return over time. This is a basic tenet of net present value (NPV) calculations. In addition to time-to-market benefits, ROI with scrum also increases by

    - Regular feedback through sprint reviews directly from stakeholders, including customers, enables course corrections early, which is less costly and time-consuming than later in the process.

    - Fewer costly defects due to automation and up-front testing means less wasted work and faster deployments.

    - Reducing costs of failure. If a scrum project is going to fail, it fails earlier and faster than waterfall projects.

- #### Higher customer satisfaction
    Scrum teams are committed to producing products and services that satisfy customers. Scrum enables happier project sponsors through the following:

    - Collaborating with customers as partners and keeping customers involved and engaged throughout projects.

    - Having a product owner who is an expert on product requirements and customer needs.

    - Keeping the product backlog updated and prioritized to respond quickly to change.

    - Demonstrating working functionality to internal stakeholders and customers in every sprint review.

    - Delivering product to end customers faster and more often with every release rather than all at once at the very end.

    - Incrementally funding projects instead of requiring large up-front commitments.

- #### Higher team morale
    Working with happy people who enjoy their jobs can be satisfying and rewarding. Self-management puts decisions that would normally be made by a manager or the organization into scrum team members’ hands. Scrum improves the morale of team members in these ways:

    - Being part of a self-managing and self-organizing team allows people to be creative, innovative, and acknowledged for their expertise.

    - Development teams may organize their team structure around people with specific work styles and personalities.

    - Scrum teams can make decisions tailored to provide balance between team members’ professional and personal lives.

    - Having a peer relationship with a business representative (product owner) on the same team aligns technical and business priorities and breaks down organizational barriers.

    - Having a scrum master, who serves the scrum team, removes impediments and shields the development team from external interferences.

    - Focusing on sustainable work practices and cadence ensures that people don’t burn out from stress or overwork.

    - Working cross-functionally allows development team members to learn new skills and to grow by teaching others.

    - Encouraging a servant-leader approach assists scrum teams in self-management and actively avoiding command-and-control methods.

    - Providing an environment of support and trust increases people’s overall motivation and morale.

    - Having face-to-face conversations helps reduce the frustration of miscommunication.

    - Ultimately, scrum teams can agree on rules about how they work to get the job done.


## 2. From the Agile Manifesto, complete the following:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
