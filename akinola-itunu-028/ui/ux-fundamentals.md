### Article on UI/UX Fundamentals;
There are many important principles within UX design but to simplify things a bit, we've broken them down into five main concepts: Empathy, strategy, usability, inclusivity, and validation. UX design is rapidly revolutionizing the world around us and how we interact with products, businesses, services, and each other. It’s essential to creating usable and desirable products that help companies, consumers, and even whole societies find solutions to difficult or troubling problems.

On the other hand, UI design, or user interface design, refers to designing visual user interfaces in software or computerized devices. It’s the overall design, the way in which information is presented, and how your users interact with your website. Throughout the user interface design design process, designers focus on either the look or style in order to achieve seamless, user-friendly, and enjoyable designs. The sign of a powerful and effective UI design is an interface that streamlines your user through a company’s unique sales funnel like an invisible guide. It empowers your users to complete goals, leaving them happier, more satisfied and highly engaged.
