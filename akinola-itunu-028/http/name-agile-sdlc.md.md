### Describe Scrum and elaborate on it's benefits in software development:

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.  It describes a set of meetings, tools, and roles that work in concert to help teams structure and manage their work.


 Scrum is a framework for getting work done, The scrum framework is heuristic; it’s based on continuous learning and adjustment to fluctuating factors. It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.
 Some of it's benefits in software developement are;
 1. Reduced risk; Scrum helps mitigate the risk of absolute project failure,
 2. Improved progress visibility and exposure; on scrum projects, every member of the project team has the opportunity to know how the project is going at any given time. Transparency and visibility make scrum an exposure model to help the project team accurately identify issues and more accurately predict how things will go as the project progresses. 
 3. Autonomy and empowerment; One of the great benefits of Scrum is the high degree of autonomy the team members acquire, encouraging and empowering them to perform increasingly complex tasks, thus distributing knowledge knowing that, if necessary, there is another member who is able to perform a certain task.
 4. Better quality; Projects exist to accomplish a vision or goal. Scrum provides the framework for continual feedback and exposure to make sure that quality is as high as possible.
