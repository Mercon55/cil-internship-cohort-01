# Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol

Transmission Control Protocol/internet protocol is an implementation of the OSI model, it's based on protocols around which the internet has been developed. It allows one computer to talk to another computer via the internet by compiling packets of data and sending them to the right locations. Tcp/ip is a layered process that comprises of 4 layers;

* Process/Application layer : this layer performs the functions of the top three layers of the OSI model(application layer, presentation layer, session layer). It is responsible for node to node communications and controls user-interface.

* Host to host layer/Transport : This layer performs functions similar to that of the Transport Layer of OSI model. It is responsible for end to end communication and error-free delivery of data. The two main protocols present in this layer are the Transmission  Control Protocol(connection oriented) and User Datagram Protocol (connectionless).

* Internet layer : This layer parallels the functions of OSI's Network Layer. It defines the protocols which are responsible for logical transmission of data over the entire network. The main protocols in this layer are Internet Protocol(IP), Internet Control Message Protocol(ICMP) and Address Resolution Protocol(ARP).

* Network Internet Layer : This layer combines the Data link layer and Pysical Layer of the OSI model. It looks out for hardware addressing and the protocols present in this layer allows for the physical transmission of data.
