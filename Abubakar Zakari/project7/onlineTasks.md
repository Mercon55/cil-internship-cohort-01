# TASK TWO OF UI/UX
## Think about the UX design process—do any of the functions or tasks that we discussed resemble anything you do in your current job?

I am a web developer (in training), with main empahsis on back-end web development using python's django framework. Lets say i have a function i wish to write a code to perform, this are the steps i usually follow;
* First i write down exactly what i want the function to do, then like a ux designer that performs user research i go online and check for python methods that i need to make the program run efficiently and if i don't find what i need specifically, i look for ways to combine diffrent aspects of various python method to get the end result i want.

* Finally, i write a prototype version of my code and test it repeatedly with diffrent input parameters to see how well it functions in diffrent situations. And finally i cross-ceck my code for secuirity purpose.

# TASK FOUR OF UI/UX
## Explain what is ux design and role of a ux designer

### What is ux design

A User experience(UX) is the relationship between a product and the person using it. UX design focuses on building products that someone can easily use and enjoy using. 

### Role of ux designer
As a ux designer my job is focused on all aspects of a product’s development, including design, usability, funcion, and even branding and marketing. My work touches the entire end-to-end journey of a user’s interaction with a product, and includes identifying new opportunities for the product and business.


### How ux differs from other design disciplines

* UX can apply to any kind of product, service, or experience; UI is specific to digital products and experiences.
* UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems; UI design is all about creating intuitive,    aesthetically-pleasing, interactive interfaces.
* UX design usually comes first in the product development process, followed by UI. The UX designer maps out the bare bones of the user journey; the UI designer then fills it in with visual and interactive elements
