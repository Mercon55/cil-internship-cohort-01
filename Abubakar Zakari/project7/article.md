## UI/UX
UI design and UX design are two of the most often confused and conflated terms in web and app design. And understandably so. They’re usually placed together in a single term, UI/UX design, and viewed from the surface they seem to be describing the same thing. It’s often hard to find solid descriptions of the two that don’t descend too far into jargon.
### UX design
User experience (UX) designers are responsible for creating an optimal experience for the user when they interact with a digital or physical product, such as a website or a coffee machine. Some focus on service design, such as designing the overall experience of using public transportation or visiting a doctor.

### UI design
User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms—e.g., voice-controlled interfaces.

## Roles under UI/UX design

UI/UX design is a multidisciplinary field with a growing range of niche specializations including UX writing, research and usability, coding, visual design, and more. UI/UX job descriptions usually mention a mix of these roles.

* UI/UX design. The scope of this job is on creating the user interface based on user research insights. To achieve this, designers use processes such as wireframing and prototyping, followed by usability testing. The UI/UX design title is the most comprehensive and may include some or all of the below functions. In most organizations, UI/UX functions are blended under one job title.
* Visual design. Visual designers are responsible for the look and feel of a physical or digital product. This can include everything from packaging to web design. They work closely with interaction designers and UI/UX copywriters to create a user experience that is aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly, and efficient. They may also assist UI/UX designers with developing high-fidelity prototypes towards the end of the design phase.
* Research and usability. UI/UX researchers focus on gathering input from users. They conduct user interviews, observe users in their natural habitat or a testing environment, host focus groups and design surveys. They are also responsible for converting structured and unstructured qualitative and quantitative data into usable insights for the UI/UX team, which means they must be skilled data analysts.
* Coding. UX engineers are liaisons between the design and engineering teams. They are responsible for taking a design and bringing it to life with code. A UX engineer’s arsenal includes computer languages such as HTML, JS, CSS, and so on.
* UI/UX writing. UI/UX writing is a niche specialty, but it helps to have an understanding of it. Microcopy is a powerful tool to create a good experience for users. These are the words we read or hear when we use a digital product and are a key element of website navigability and the overall experience.


## Skills required for UI/UX

UX designers use a combination of technical skills and workplace skills in their design work. Some of these skills are specific to the world of UI/UX, while others are more general. Chances are you already have skills that will transfer into a new career in UX design. 

### Technical skills

* Prototyping, wireframing, user flows, mockups : A huge part of the product development process is envisioning what a product will look like. Depending on the stage of development, you might do this by creating wireframes, low or high-fidelity prototypes, mockups, or user flows. Let’s define these terms.

* Visual design and design software : Both UX designers and UI designers use visual design software, like Figma, Sketch, Photoshop, and Illustrator, to create the visual elements of a product. Besides proficiency in the tools, you should build your knowledge of visual design best practices for things like typography, color theory, layout, icons, and general design theory.

* User research and usability testing : To design a product that solves a user problem, meets a user need, or generally delights a user, you first need to understand who that user is. That’s where user research comes into play. Conducting the right type of user research for the product or feature you’re designing can empower you to make a product even better. As you develop prototypes, you’ll conduct user testing to validate your design choices. Knowing how to iterate through these two user-centric phases can help make you a more effective designer. This skill is so critical that some companies have a specialized role on their UX team known as the UX researcher. 

* Agile : Agile, a set of project management practices popular in the software development world, is based on an iterative approach to building a product. Since many software development teams use the agile methodology, it would make sense that UX designers could benefit from an understanding of this popular product management approach as well. 


* Information architecture : Information architecture (IA) involves effectively organizing and structuring content. When designed well, IA helps users find the information they’re looking for or complete their task. UX designers can facilitate this by making it easy for users to understand where they are, where they need to go, and what’s next.

* Application development : While UX designers are not generally expected to write code—that’s a task for developers—it can help to have a basic understanding of application development, including languages like JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.


### workplace skills

* Collaboration : As a UX designer, you’ll be collaborating with other teams on a regular basis. Depending on the project and phase of development, you might work with leadership to define business goals, user interface (UI) designers to add visual elements to a mockup or high-fidelity prototype, or developers to translate your designs into code.Working as part of a team also means knowing how to give and receive feedback and incorporate new ideas on how to make the best possible product.

* Communication and presentation : Communication and collaboration go hand in hand. And it’s not just your team you’ll need to communicate with. Strong communications skills help you to get more valuable data from customers when conducting user research and build enthusiasm in stakeholders when presenting your designs. Good UX often relies on effective visual communication and written communication (UX writing) as well.   

* Prioritization and time management : Companies are often looking for UX designers who can manage their time and prioritize tasks to address the most critical needs first. You might be working on multiple projects (or multiple parts of the same project) over the course of a day. Practice staying organized and flexible in your current tasks, and you’ll set yourself up for success in the world of UX design. 


## Basics required for a good UI/UX design
The following are some of the basic requirements for a good UI/UX design;

* Keep the interface simple. The best interfaces are almost invisible to the user. They avoid unnecessary elements and are clear in the language they use on labels and in messaging.
* Create consistency and use common UI elements. By using common elements in your UI, users feel more comfortable and are able to get things done more quickly.  It is also important to create patterns in language, layout and design throughout the site to help facilitate efficiency. Once a user learns how to do something, they should be able to transfer that skill to other parts of the site. 
* Be purposeful in page layout.  Consider the spatial relationships between items on the page and structure the page based on importance. Careful placement of items can help draw attention to the most important pieces of information and can aid scanning and readability.
* Strategically use color and texture. You can direct attention toward or redirect attention away from items using color, light, contrast, and texture to your advantage.
* Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity. Carefully consider how you use typeface. Different sizes, fonts, and arrangement of the text to help increase scanability, legibility and readability.
* Make sure that the system communicates what’s happening.  Always inform your users of location, actions, changes in state, or errors. The use of various UI elements to communicate status and, if necessary, next steps can reduce frustration for your user. 
* Think about the defaults. By carefully thinking about and anticipating the goals people bring to your site, you can create defaults that reduce the burden on the user.  This becomes particularly important when it comes to form design where you might have an opportunity to have some fields pre-chosen or filled out.
