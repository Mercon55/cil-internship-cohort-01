## WHAT IS SCRUM

Scrum is a framework that help's in product management to address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.

## BENEFITS OF SCRUM

* Better quality : Scrum provides the framework for continual feedback and exposure to make sure that quality is as high as possible to be able to acomplish the preset project goal or vission.

* Decreased time to market : Scrum has been proven to deliver value to the end customer 30 to 40 percent faster than traditional methods due to factors such as earlier initiation of development, seperating highest-priority requirement from low priority items.

* Increased return on investment : The decrease in time to market is one key reason that scrum projects realize a higher return on investment (ROI). Because revenue and other targeted benefits start coming in sooner, earlier accumulation means higher total return over time.

* Higher customer satisfaction : Scrum teams are committed to producing products and services that satisfy customers. Scrum enables happier project sponsors through collaborating with customers as partners, having a product owner who is an expert on product requirement and customer needs and keeping the product backlog updated.

* Higher team morale : Working with happy people who enjoy their jobs can be satisfying and rewarding. Self-management puts decisions that would normally be made by a manager or the organization into scrum team members’ hands. Scrum improves the morale of team members by being part of a self-managing and self organising team which allows people to be creative and innovatie.

* Reduced risk : Scrum helps mitigate the risk of absolute project failure and spending large amounts of time and money with no return on investment by delivering tangible product early and forcing scrum teams to fail early if they’re going to fail at all.
