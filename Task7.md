#(UI/UX DESIGN)

Tutorial Question: Your mission for today is to start browsing websites and apps you frequently use and to make a note of anything that you find intuitive or frustrating.

##Gmail for web

Gmail is a free Web-based e-mail service that provides users with a gigabyte of storage for messages and provides the ability to search for specific messages.                                                                                       
Using Gmail It was easy to accomplish my goals. However, when you have more than one email attached to it, it becomes difficult to sign out a single email without signing out all the emails. This frustrated me and makes me question why I can’t have an option to sign out a single email too.

#FUNDAMENTALS OF UI/UX DESIGN

##What is UI Design

User interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces and other forms—e.g., voice-controlled interfaces. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable.

##What is UX Design

UX design is rapidly revolutionizing the world around us and how we interact with products, businesses, services, and each other. It’s essential to creating usable and desirable products that help companies, consumers, and even whole societies find solutions to difficult or troubling problems. User experience (UX) is the relationship between a product and the person using it. UX design focuses on building products that someone can easily use and enjoy using. 

#Differences Between UI/UX Design

>1. UX design is all about the overall feel of the experience, while UI design is all about how the product’s interfaces look and function.
>2. With the skeleton of the product mapped out, the UI designer steps in to bring it to life while the UX designer maps out the journey, the UI designer focuses on all the details that make this journey possible. 
>3. UX design is all about identifying and solving user problems; UI design is all about creating intuitive, aesthetically-pleasing, interactive interfaces.
>4. UX can apply to any kind of product, service, or experience; UI is specific to digital products and experiences.
>5. UX design usually comes first in the product development process, followed by UI. The UX designer maps out the bare bones of the user journey; the UI designer then fills it in with visual and interactive elements.

##Principles Of UI/UX

>1.Meet the User’s Need
  UI/UX Design is user-centred, so first and foremost you have to ensure that the design meets the needs of the user. Your design should help the users achieve their desired outcome seamlessly.
>2.Hierarchy
    This refers to how the content or information is organized throughout the design. Which screen comes before the others? Which elements or information need more attention than others? Hierarchy controls the order in which information is consumed and processed. A design with clear hierarchy helps users easily scan for the information they need and go about their tasks smoothly.
>3. Visibility of System Status
    Users should be able to receive feedback on the actions they take. Your design should provide them with information on what is going on and show users their system status. If a user is downloading a file, a good design should show some sort of progress bar to show how much time is left for the download to complete instead of leaving the user in the dark. 
>4. User Control and Freedom
    The design should give users control in the process, allow them to redo, undo and cancel an action that they have already taken. A product that considers this principle is Google docs. You can undo changes you have made to a document and redo any change you reversed.
>5. Consistency and Standards
    Your design should follow standards and use consistent concepts throughout the entire product. This allows users to become familiar with new products, so they know what actions to take without any extra learning. Take a look at products from Microsoft office, they have a general look and feel. So if you know how to use Microsoft Word, adopting Microsoft Powerpoint or Spreadsheet would be easier and faster.

#Benefits of UI/UX Design

>2. Ultimately: UX improves users’ quality of life
>3. Good UX maximizes revenue
