### Comments I can make about the internship

-   The internship is a very great environment for learning completely new things.
-   Becks is really ready to help out in any issue.
-   I have learnt a lot in the short period of the internship.
-   We have a very strong bond in my team and we share ideas as much as possible.

In general, it is a very interesting programme and I commend everyone involved in the planning.
