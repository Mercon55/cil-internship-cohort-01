# Article: Fundamentals of UI/UX

*What is UI? what is UX?* 
User Experience(UX) is a design process that seeks to adapt products to intuitive human actions.
The term was first used by Donald Norman, a Cognitive Scientist and User Experience expert while working at Apple. He describes it thus:
     "User experience encompasses all aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products."
The ultimate purpose of UX design is to create easy, efficient, relevant, and all-round pleasant experiences for the user.

While user experience is a conglomeration of tasks focused on the optimization of a product for effective and enjoyable use, user interface design is its complement; the look and feel, the presentation and interactivity of a product.
In relation to websites and apps, UI design considers the look, feel, and interactivity of the product. Itâ€™s all about making sure that the user interface of a product is as intuitive as possible, and that means carefully considering each and every visual, interactive element the user might encounter.
A UI designer will think about icons and buttons, typography and color schemes, spacing, imagery, and responsive design

 Generally:
 * UX focuses on the overall feel of the user experience
 * UI considars all the visual, interactive elements of a product intervae such as buttons,icons, space, typography, color schemes, and responsive design.
 * UI design  is only applicable in digital products
 * UX design is applicable in both digital and non digital products
