UX designers are advocates for their users. They research, iterate, test various design solutions. Making sure the product is easy to use and solves problems.
# Practical Excercise

*start browsing websites and apps you use frequently and to make a note of anything that you find intuitive or frustrating*

* Watsapp- Single click to begin chats are intuitive, deleting sent messages and instead of having a clean wipeout, leaving a note that a message has been deleted, I find frustrating.

* Opening a new tab on google chrome by clicking a + button; I find intuitive

* 'My computer' in windows 8.1 is symbolised by the image of a desktop computer, therefore the I intuitively know that by clicking on the computer image, I am redirected to my computer

* 
* Android Phone Call receive/Reject buttons by sliding towards the green area to receive and red area to reject calls I find intuitive but for a color blind person, can be frustrating
